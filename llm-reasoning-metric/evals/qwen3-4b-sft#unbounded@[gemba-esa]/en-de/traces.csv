Based on the source segment and machine translation surrounded with triple backticks, identify error types in the translation and classify them. The categories of errors are: accuracy (addition, mistranslation, omission, untranslated text), fluency (character encoding, grammar, inconsistency, punctuation, register, spelling), style (awkward), terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), non-translation, other, or no-error.
Each error is classified as one of two categories: major or minor. Major errors disrupt the flow and make the understandability of text difficult or impossible. Minor errors are errors that do not disrupt the flow significantly and what the text is trying to say is still understandable.```","<answer>
