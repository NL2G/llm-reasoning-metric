Wait, the original Spanish translation is: ""@ user22 oh, ¬øquieres que el navegador arregle el orden de DOM?"" 

The key points: 

- The username ""@user22"" in the original has no space. The translation has a space, which is a minor fluency error (spelling or formatting). 

- The rest of the translation is accurate. ""Quieres que el navegador arregle el orden de DOM"" correctly translates ""you want the browser to fix up the DOM order"". 

So the only error is the space in the username. 

But the user might have thought that ""arregle"" is incorrect. However, ""arreglar"" is the correct verb for ""fix up"" in this context. So the translation is accurate except for the space in the username. 

Therefore, the error is minor in fluency due to the space. 

Final classification: 

Major: None  
Minor: fluency/spelling - "" @ user22"" (space between @ and user22)```","The translation is mostly accurate, with only a minor formatting error in the username.

  - ""viajar a los peces"" (literal mistranslation of ""traveling to the fish"" ‚Üí incorrect meaning).  
  - ""huevos desordenados"" (incorrect term for ""scrambled eggs""; ""revueltos"" is correct).  
  These errors significantly impact meaning and accuracy.  

- **Minor Errors (2):**  
  - ""se ve que cualquier cosa que ocurra"" (slightly awkward phrasing but understandable).  
  - ""para hablar"" (misrepresents ""so to speak""; ""para decir"" or ""para hablar de"" would be better).  
  These are less severe but still affect clarity.  

- **Overall:**  
  The translation preserves most meaning but has critical errors in key terms. While the rest of the text is largely accurate, the major mistranslations reduce the score below 66. The score reflects partial meaning preservation with notable inaccuracies.",en-es
