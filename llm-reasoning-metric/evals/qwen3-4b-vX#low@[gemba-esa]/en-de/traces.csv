- **Minor error**: ""Zweites Werk"" (second plant) is grammatically correct, but ""Werk"" (plant/factory) is slightly less precise than ""Zweigwerk"" (branch plant) or ""Zweite Anlage"" (second facility).

- **Major Errors (2):**  
  1. **Mistranslation:** ""Hilf dem Kriegseinsatz"" (""Help the war effort"") is inaccurate. The intended meaning ""Support the war effort"" is better rendered as ""Unterstützen Sie den Kriegseinsatz"" (formal imperative). This directly alters the meaning, reducing the translation's accuracy.  
  2. **Punctuation:** ""‘, murmelte Nemic"" is incorrect. The proper punctuation should be ""„...“, murmelte Nemic,"" which is critical for clarity and grammatical correctness in German.  

- **Minor Errors (2):**  
  1. **Punctuation:** Missing period at the end of the final sentence (""Sollte man nicht auch Hilfe an die Howland-Front senden?"").  
  2. **Style:** ""Sende Hilfe an die Kurgan-Front"" uses the imperative form, which is acceptable in direct speech but may feel overly direct in a neutral context.

```Tim Whitehouse, a former EPA enforcement attorney and the executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, praised the Biden administration's recent improvements on enforcement while acknowledging the strong headwinds such efforts face. ""It takes years of sustained funding and political support to build a good enforcement program,"" he told me. ""The instability in Congress is not only demoralizing to EPA staff but undermines their ability to think strategically over the long term.""```
German translation:
```Tim Whitehouse, ein ehemaliger EPA-Verfolgungsanwalt und Geschäftsführer von Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, lobte die jüngsten Verbesserungen der Biden-Regierung bei der Durchsetzung und erkannte gleichzeitig die starken Gegenwinde an, denen solche Bemühungen ausgesetzt sind. „Es braucht Jahre anhaltender Finanzierung und politischer Unterstützung, um ein gutes Durchsetzungsprogramm aufzubauen“, sagte er zu mir. „Die Instabilität im Kongress ist nicht nur demoralisierend für das EPA-Personal, sondern untergräbt auch seine Fähigkeit, langfristig strategisch zu denken.“```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Gegenwinde"" (should be ""Gegenwinden"")
Minor:
terminology/inappropriate for context - ""Verfolgungsanwalt"" (more accurately ""EPA-Verfolgungsbeamter"" or ""EPA-Verfolgungsanwalt"" might be contextually appropriate, but ""Verfolgungsanwalt"" is a direct translation that could be considered a terminology inconsistency)```","The translation preserves the core meaning of the original text, with only two notable errors. The major error (""Gegenwinde"" instead of ""Gegenwinden"") alters the grammatical structure and slightly shifts the nuance of ""headwinds,"" though the overall message remains clear. The minor terminology issue (""Verfolgungsanwalt"") is contextually debatable but does not significantly disrupt the translation's clarity or intent.

accuracy/mistranslation - ""wären angefangen"" (incorrect conditional form for ""would have started"")

Minor:
fluency/grammar - ""wäre"" (inconsistent use in conditional structure)```","**Score: 66**  
**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves most of the original meaning, with the exception of a major conditional form error (""wären angefangen"" instead of ""hätten angefangen"") and a minor grammar inconsistency (""wäre"" in the conditional structure). While the conditional error is significant, the rest of the translation is grammatically correct and semantically accurate. The emoji and overall structure are preserved, and the minor error is relatively minor. Thus, the translation scores 66, reflecting most meaning preserved with few grammar mistakes.",en-de
