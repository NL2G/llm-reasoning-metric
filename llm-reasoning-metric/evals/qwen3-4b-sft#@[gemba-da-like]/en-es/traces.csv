Unfortunately, this consultation paper seems like a further attempt to impose controls on the sector. A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved. Only by adopting these measures will we start to address the current housing crisis. Anything else is simply not going to work.

In an effort to defuse the tension with the farmers, the government agreed to a gradual removal of the diesel subsidy over three years and to keeping the exemption from the car tax. The farmers pooh-poohed the concessions as insufficient. On January 4th an aggressive group of them prevented Robert Habeck, the economy minister, from disembarking from a ferry on his return from a family holiday. If the train drivers are similarly unimpressed, that could prove expensive for German business, reckons IW Köln, a think-tank. The rail strike could cost businesses €100m ($110m) a day if it forced them to interrupt production. The car, chemical and steel industries, Germany's biggest, are especially reliant on rail transport.

""That was... one of the weirder shadowjumps I've ever done... Thanto kat'olon..."" Kayel gasped for air. His eyes somehow were glowing black, and a dark energy drifted across his body. However, as he spoke, the colour returned to Kayel's organic plating and his eyes turned back to their normal yellow.

And I have a lot of experience. I've worked internationally. I've worked this continent. I've worked at different states, different market segments. And what I found is people are really intrigued by that. They want to know kind of what the behind the scenes is. So some of these videos are going to be tips from somebody that actually works in this industry and I think that's what separates me a little bit from possibly other travel bloggers that you might follow. You know, I may not have worked for, say, even in the cruise industry, but I had to take courses in it for my hospitality degree. So even if I haven't worked in it, I've been educated on it.

Below, Nyssi scrambled to her feet. She was pretty sure she had broken something, but her weird, unnatural healing powers had already kicked in. The same couldn't have been said for Thassalin, who was lying in a lump, resting against the one tree that hadn't collapsed under his weight. Nyssi did her best to try and reach Thassalin but she could barely see more than a couple of meters in front of her. Everything was pitch black and engulfed in unholy shadows. And in said shadows, something was screaming and screeching.

Nyssi hizo lo que pudo para intentar llegar a Thassalin, pero apenas podía ver más de dos metros por delante de ella. Todo estaba completamente oscuro y envuelto en sombras siniestras.

0430 Itania time. Cohren hated waking up this early. Mainly because it was his responsibility to wake everyone else up in his company. Silently stepping out of his bunk, he put on his combat fatigues, throwing on his assault vest, and packed up his belongings from his locker, being careful with a particular small box.

After checking his ammo pouches, he quietly walked out of the barracks, mud and ice squelching under his boots.
