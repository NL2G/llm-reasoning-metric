```Affordable furniture DIYs are always a hit here on Lone Fox, so I wanted to share with you guys how I created this nightstand from a simple crate from IKEA. So this is the Nagle crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA. And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions. You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just e 6,000 these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to. And once you are done, you have a very simple, minimal nightstand.```
German translation:
```Erschwingliche Möbel sind hier bei Lone Fox immer ein Hit, also wollte ich mit euch teilen, wie ich diesen Nachttisch aus einer simplen IKEA-Kiste gemacht habe. Das ist die Kagglig-Kiste, die man für etwa 10 € bei IKEA bekommt. Und ich habe dann angefangen, sie einfach nach der Anleitung zusammenzubauen. Man muss einfach alle Elemente zusammenschrauben. Und sobald alle verschraubt sind, habt ihr eine einfache Holzkiste. Jetzt wollte ich an der Unterseite der Holzkiste ein Bein anbringen, also habe ich sie mit diesen kleinen Holzschalen erhöht, die ich im Bastelladen gefunden habe. Sie sind aus einfachem Holz, sehr ähnlich wie das von IKEA, und ich habe sie einfach festgeklebt. Ihr könnt auch eine Nagelpistole benutzen, wenn ihr wollt. Und wenn ihr fertig seid, habt ihr einen sehr einfachen, minimalen Nachttisch.```

At a much scaled-down level, the same can occur across Sydney's town centres located around transport nodes. Inner suburbs must also evolve, with a swing to more affordable apartment living at heights below the tree tops on key sites. Of course, the new growth in housing needs to be well-designed and trees, landscaping and parks need to be included along with other essential infrastructure.```

The German translation preserves the meaning and context of the English source, with only minor errors.

1. ""Pilotenausbildung"" is close to the correct translation ""Piloten-Training"", but the hyphen is missing. This is a minor error as it doesn't change the meaning.
2. ""Flying"" is correctly translated as ""Fliegen"".
3. ""TeaganAir"" is correctly translated as it's a proper noun.
4. ""Flugschule"" is not the correct translation for ""GroundSchool"". The correct translation would be ""Flugunterricht"" or ""Flugschule"" (with hyphen). However, ""Flugschule"" is not incorrect as it can mean ""flight school"" in some contexts, but it's not the best translation for ""GroundSchool"".

Considering these points, the translation is mostly accurate with minor errors. Therefore, the score is 90.",en-de

```The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Disagree. If the enemy of your enemy were your friend, he'd explicitly be your friend. You know, oftentimes people can work together for a time, united by their dislike for something or someone. But if that relationship was conceived by your mutual dislike for whatever that thing is, what's to stop that relationship from dissolving or becoming hostile after that thing is taken care of. Like the foundation of a friendship is much more stable than that. But you know, I also understand the short term strategy behind it, so I'll just disagree.```

Score: 86
The translation is mostly accurate with only a few minor errors. The main error is in the sentence ""is to stop that relationship from dissolving or becoming hostile after that thing is taken care of,"" which should be translated as ""ist es möglich, dass diese Beziehung aufhebt oder feindlicher wird, nachdem diese Sache behandelt wird."" The minor error is in the fluency and inconsistency of ""I'll just disagree,"" which should be translated as ""Ich werde einfach nicht zustimmen.""

The translation mostly preserves the meaning and grammar is mostly correct, but there are a few minor errors that affect the overall quality. The main issue is the mistranslation of ""call to sub him out"" as ""Anweisungen"" instead of ""Austausch"". This is a significant error as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The minor error is the use of ""aufführen"" instead of ""Auftritt"", which is not contextually appropriate. However, the overall meaning is still clear, and the grammar is mostly correct.",en-de
