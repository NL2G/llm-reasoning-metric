Tap, tap, tap was all you could hear from the farthest room on the left in the south wing of the eternally cold palace. The servants passing by always wondered what was in the room, scared of what was inside. Rumors danced around the halls by the maids. It was thought that the Ice King’s deceased wife, Eirwen, was in that room, waiting to be let out.

Toc, toc, toc era todo lo que se podía escuchar desde la habitación más alejada a la izquierda en el ala sur del palacio eternamente frío. Los sirvientes que pasaban siempre se preguntaban qué había en la habitación, asustados por lo que había dentro. Los rumores corrían por los pasillos entre las sirvientas. Se pensaba que la difunta esposa del Rey Hielo, Eirwen, estaba en esa habitación, esperando ser liberada.

“We got contacts” Shaw shouted through the radio as orange tracers fired from the ridge. Bullets pinged off the tanks side as Shock Troopers leaped off the tanks, taking cover behind them. An anti missile rocked, streaked by and slammed into the ground behind the formation, exploding and throwing debris onto one of the tanks. Another slammed into the side of a Stryker, a APS-Cerberus, and exploded. Its crew scrambled out and dove for cover as the ammo cooked off.

The walk home was quiet, but so loud. The thoughts infecting my brain were booming, and the regret of not having stayed to help flashed over multiple times. I finally arrived home, almost brought to tears by the dreadful walk in the burst of sounds from the clouds above, the thunderous booms were enough to frighten any person sometimes. Dad was already passed out on the couch, some rerun of an older movie, probably 10-12 years old; sighing, I quietly crept my way back to my room. Flopping in the bed, I wasn’t able to keep my eyes open for long. Before long, slumber crept up on me.

Papá ya estaba desmayado en el sofá, una repetición de una película antigua, probablemente de 10 a 12 años; Suspirando, me arrastré silenciosamente de regreso a mi habitación.

Hello, it's Bayano with Bayano Reno. We're going to prepare some grout. The tars looks to be about 14, 15 years old. We're going to do it just to stabilize the tales because the way it is, the tars looks good. It's just losing up in some area. We don't want to play the whole tile grout. We're just going to do some repair to last until we are ready to do a full renovation. Yes is this a recording?

Simplemente vamos a hacer algunas reparaciones para que duren hasta que estemos listos para hacer una renovación completa. Sí, ¿es esto una grabación?

The protests were ostensibly set off by the government's decision to end subsidies for diesel fuel used in agriculture and to cut an exemption from car tax for farm vehicles. These measures pushed farmers over the edge. It also mobilised other angry workers, already straining under the pressure of inflation, recession and the government's self-imposed austerity. On January 9th drivers of freight and passenger trains at Deutsche Bahn, the national railway, began a strike over working hours and pay.

También movilizó a otros trabajadores enojados, que ya estaban tensos bajo la presión de la inflación, la recesión y la austeridad autoimpuesta por el gobierno.
