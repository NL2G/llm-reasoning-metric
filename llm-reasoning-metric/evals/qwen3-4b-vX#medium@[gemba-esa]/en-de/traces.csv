```Exercise is not just for those looking to be triathlon athletes or for looking better. It also benefits quality of life—thoughts, moods, productivity—it is all connected. Taking breaks from the desk make time at your desk more productive.```
German translation:

accuracy/mistranslation - ""Triathlonsportler werden"" (should be ""Triathleten"" for ""triathlon athletes"")  
Minor:
style/awkward - ""an Ihrem Schreibtisch"" (could be more natural as ""an Ihrem Schreibtisch"" is correct but slightly formal)  

**Note:** The translation is mostly accurate. The term ""Triathlonsportler"" is a valid but slightly more specific term than ""Triathleten,"" which is the common term for triathlon athletes. The use of ""an Ihrem Schreibtisch"" is grammatically correct but may feel slightly formal compared to the source's tone.```","**Score: 66**  
**Reasoning:**  
The translation is mostly accurate, preserving the core meaning of the source text. However, it contains one **major error** (""Triathlonsportler werden"" instead of ""Triathleten"") that misrepresents the term for ""triathlon athletes,"" which is a critical detail. This error slightly reduces the accuracy. Additionally, the phrase ""an Ihrem Schreibtisch"" is grammatically correct but slightly formal, which is a **minor style issue**. Despite these two errors, the translation maintains most of the intended meaning and structure, with few grammar mistakes. Thus, it falls into the ""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes"" category (66).",en-de

The translation preserves most of the original meaning (e.g., ""Gewalt hervorruft"" for ""violence begets violence,"" ""Jahrtausende lang... gewidmet"" for ""millennia devoted""). However, two key issues impact quality:  
1. **Major error:** ""Du musst es nicht sagen"" (You don't have to say) misinterprets ""You don't have to"" as a direct imperative, which may feel overly literal in context.  
2. **Minor errors:** ""Der Rat ist weg"" (inconsistent use of ""weg"" for ""gone"") and ""Wir verbringen unser ganzes Leben damit"" (awkward phrasing, singular ""Leben"" vs. plural ""lives"").

""Solarbrei"" (literally ""solar porridge"") is not a standard term in German and may confuse readers, especially if ""solar pap"" is a technical or fictional term.

- **Major Errors (2):**  
  1. **Tense Mismatch:** The German translation uses ""war"" (past tense) for ""was"" in ""the princess’ birthday was in a few days,"" which is grammatically correct in German but contradicts the annotation's claim of a mistake. However, the user's annotation explicitly labels this as a major error, so it is considered a significant issue.  
  2. **Terminology Error:** ""Spiegel"" (mirror) is incorrectly used instead of ""Schimmer"" or ""Glitz"" (glint/sparkle) to describe the ""sad glint in her eyes."" This is a critical semantic error.  

- **Minor Error (1):**  
  The construction ""und erinnerte sich daran"" in the direct quote is awkward but grammatically correct, as noted in the annotation. This is a minor fluency issue.

**Reasoning:**  
- **Major Errors (20 points):**  
  - ""Haushaltspolitiker"" (inaccurate for ""budget hawks"") and ""Liebäugeln mit dem Risiko"" (poor metaphor for ""brinkmanship"") significantly affect meaning preservation. These terms deviate from the intended nuances, reducing the translation's accuracy.  
  - ""Haushaltspolitiker"" is used inconsistently (less precise than ""budget hawks""), further impacting clarity.  

- **Minor Errors (10 points):**  
  - ""der gangbarste Weg sei"" (awkward superlative structure) is a stylistic issue but does not disrupt overall comprehension.  
  - Inconsistent terminology (""Haushaltspolitiker"" vs. ""budget hawks"") slightly reduces precision.  

- **Strengths (20 points):**  
  - Core meaning of the original text is preserved: the congressman's stance on the CR, the 1% spending cut, and the goal of ending ""brinkmanship.""  
  - Grammar is mostly correct, with only minor style issues.

**Reasoning:**  
The German translation preserves the core meaning of the original text, which is the primary focus of the scoring. However, there are two critical issues:  
1. **Major Error (Quotation Marks):** The German translation omits quotation marks around the FAA's quote (""seltene, aber katastrophale Natur eines Flugunfalls""), which disrupts the precise attribution of the statement. While the German text includes double quotation marks, the original English uses single quotes, and the user's annotation explicitly identifies this as a major error. This is a significant grammatical and contextual issue.  
2. **Minor Errors:**  
   - ""Sicherheitsaufzeichnungen"" is less common than ""Sicherheitsdaten"" or ""Sicherheitsberichte"" for ""safety records.""  
   - ""im Laufe der Zeit aus"" is slightly less natural than ""im Laufe der Zeit ausgleichen sich,"" though the meaning is clear.

```Another useful resource the FAA links to is the Boeing Worldwide Statistical Summary of Commercial Jet Airplane Accidents 1959-2022, which assesses plane-type safety by breaking down accidents based on the aircraft model. According to the report, which was published in September 2023, the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 are the aircraft models with the fewest total hull losses, an accident in which the aircraft is destroyed beyond repair. There are a few additional models in the report that have never experienced a hull loss, including the double-decker behemoth Airbus A380. But those models had accumulated fewer than 1 million departures at the time of the report.```

Unfällen, bei denen das Flugzeug irreparabel zerstört wird.

```Major:
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Totalverluste"" (incorrect term for ""total hull losses""; should be ""Hüllenverluste"")

- **Major Error:** The term ""Totalverluste"" (incorrectly used for ""total hull losses"") is a critical mistranslation.

- **Minor Issues:** The addition of ""d. h."" (not in the source) and the awkward phrasing ""doppelstöckige Riesenflugzeug"" (for ""double-decker behemoth"") are minor fluency/style problems. These do not severely hinder understanding but slightly reduce clarity.

- **Major Error (40 points):** The term ""Optikbrille"" (optical goggles) is incorrect for ""Thermal goggles"" (Wärmebildbrille).

- **Minor Error (10 points):** The plural form ""Panzers"" is incorrect; ""Panzer"" (singular) is the correct form. This is a minor grammar issue but does not disrupt the overall meaning.  
- **Remaining Accuracy (10 points):** The rest of the translation is grammatically correct and preserves the intended meaning. The action sequence and technical terms (e.g., ""Wärmebildmodus"" for ""Thermal mode"") are accurately translated.

```So once all that is done, I wipe away all the excess powder with a little bit of alcohol and a paper towel. Super easy to clean, and then I apply my cuticle oil. This is actually face oil from T, but I didn't like how it was so stinky. I didn't want to put it on my face, so I use it as a cuticle oil. And this is the final product of my nails. I love them and I'm obsessed. A couple of frequently asked questions. How long does my nails last. I usually leave my nails on for two weeks. Sometimes I take them off early because y'all know I do my own hair, and I gotta have my libs when I do my hair, because it's easy to grip.```

terminology/inappropriate for context - ""Libs"" (direct transliteration of ""libs"" as a slang term, which has no equivalent in German and is unclear in context)

The translation preserves most of the meaning (e.g., clear steps for nail care, use of ""Nagelöl,"" and context of ""Gesichtsöl"").
