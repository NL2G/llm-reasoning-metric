```Hey Psychtogoers, and welcome back to our channel. Thank you so much for all the love you've given us. Your ongoing support has helped us make psychology and mental health more accessible to everyone. Now let's continue. We've all done something self- destructive at some point in our lives. Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual. So here are seven common behaviors of a destructive person.```

Minor:  
none  

**Explanation:**  
- **Major error (accuracy/mistranslation):** The term ""track"" in ""FlightAware data track"" likely refers to ""tracking data"" (e.g., monitoring or following flight data). The Spanish translation ""seguimiento de datos"" translates to ""tracking of data,"" which is technically correct but lacks the nuance of ""track"" as a verb (e.g., ""to track data""). This could lead to ambiguity in the context of FlightAware's data services.  
- **No minor errors:** The translation is grammatically correct, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains clarity. The phrase ""Seguimiento de datos de FlightAware"" is fluent and accurately conveys the intended meaning, though the term ""track"" is slightly ambiguous in the translation.```","**Score: 66**  
**Reasoning:** The translation ""Seguimiento de datos de FlightAware"" is grammatically correct and maintains clarity. However, the term ""track"" in the original is contextually about ""tracking data"" (as a verb), while ""seguimiento de datos"" (tracking of data) is technically accurate but lacks the nuance of ""track"" as a dynamic process.

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
- **accuracy/mistranslation**: ""anular condenas erróneas"" (literal translation of ""strike down wrongful convictions"") is slightly off. ""Strike down"" in legal contexts often implies invalidating or overturning a conviction, while ""anular"" (cancel) is more neutral.

- **style/awkward**: The phrase ""graves consecuencias no deseadas"" (serious unintended consequences) is slightly awkward in Spanish, as ""no deseadas"" is not commonly used in this context. ""Inesperadas"" (unexpected) would be more natural.

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
**accuracy/mistranslation** - ""Le diré que le dije la verdad"" (misinterprets ""I tell you what I told you the truth"" as a redundant structure, losing the original intent of conveying the truth directly).  
**terminology/inappropriate for context** - ""captaron mi intención"" (incorrectly translates ""told my drift"" as ""caught my intention,"" which is not the intended meaning of the slang term ""drift"" in the context of communication).  

Minor:  
**style/awkward** - ""diré"" (the verb ""diré"" is grammatically correct, but the phrasing ""Le diré que le dije la verdad"" is slightly awkward and redundant compared to the original's concise tone).```","**Score: 50**  
**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves most of the context and structure but has two critical errors that significantly alter the meaning. The phrase ""Le diré que le dije la verdad"" misinterprets the original's intent, creating redundancy instead of clarity. Additionally, ""captaron mi intención"" incorrectly translates the slang ""drift,"" which is crucial for the intended meaning. While the rest of the translation is grammatically correct and maintains the formal tone, these major errors reduce the overall meaning preservation.

1. **Major error**: A space after the `@` symbol in `@ user13` (fluency/punctuation issue). While this is technically correct in Spanish, the annotation highlights it as a significant flaw.  
2. **Minor error**: Omission of the article *""una""* in *""relaciones""*, which is contextually acceptable in the phrase *""estar en relaciones""* (a common expression in Spanish).

**Reasoning:**  
- **Major Errors (2):**  
  1. **""chimenea"" (fireplace)** is incorrectly used instead of **""chimenea"" (chimney)** in both sentences. This misalignment of terms leads to a significant loss of meaning, as the original text refers to the **chimney** (not a fireplace) in the second sentence.  
  2. **Repetition of ""chimenea""** in the second sentence (referring to the chimney) further compounds the error, as the term is inappropriate for the context.

**Overall Assessment:**  
The translation fails to preserve the intended meaning due to critical term errors (fireplace vs. chimney) and repeated incorrect terminology.

```In 2019, Ukraine adopted a law that makes using the Ukrainian language obligatory in all spheres of public life, including government, medicine, science, education, and the media. Failure to comply can result in fines. Since 2022, when the military conflict with Russia began, Ukraine has undertaken a campaign of total de-Russification, with MPs saying it is necessary in order to defend against Russian influence. Local authorities have introduced complete bans on Russian-language works of art, performances, books, films, songs, and its study in schools and universities, and recommended that schoolchildren communicate in Ukrainian even during breaks.```

```Cohren lifted his thumb and index finger to his throat mic, shifting his pack on his back while he did. “All units in Exodus Company, meet at Motor Pool West when you're finished. We are heading out with the 1st Armored Platoon at 0500”```
Spanish translation:
```Cohren se llevó el pulgar y el índice al micrófono de la garganta, mientras se ajustaba la mochila en la espalda. ""Todas las unidades de la Compañía Éxodo, reúnanse en el Parque de Vehículos Oeste cuando terminen. Partiremos con el 1er Pelotón Blindado a las 0500""```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Parque de Vehículos Oeste"" (should be ""Estacionamiento de Vehículos Oeste"" or ""Parche de Vehículos Oeste"" for ""Motor Pool West"")
terminology/inappropriate for context - ""micrófono de la garganta"" (non-standard term; ""micrófono de cuello"" is more appropriate)

Minor:
style/awkward - ""reúnanse en el Parque de Vehículos Oeste cuando terminen"" (imperative structure is correct, but ""Parque de Vehículos"" may not align with the military term ""Motor Pool"")```","**Score: 66**  
**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves the core meaning of the original text, including the actions (moving fingers to the throat mic, adjusting the pack) and the directive to units. However, two major terminology errors occur:  
1. **""Parque de Vehículos Oeste""** (incorrect for ""Motor Pool West""; should be ""Estacionamiento de Vehículos Oeste"" or ""Parche de Vehículos Oeste"").  
2. **""micrófono de la garganta""** (non-standard; ""micrófono de cuello"" is more appropriate).  

While these errors affect accuracy, the overall message and structure are clear. The minor stylistic issue (""Parque de Vehículos"") is less critical than the terminology errors. The translation avoids major grammatical mistakes, making it ""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes"" (66).",en-es
