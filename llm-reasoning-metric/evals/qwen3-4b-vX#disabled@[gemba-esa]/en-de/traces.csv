```The protests were ostensibly set off by the government's decision to end subsidies for diesel fuel used in agriculture and to cut an exemption from car tax for farm vehicles. These measures pushed farmers over the edge. It also mobilised other angry workers, already straining under the pressure of inflation, recession and the government's self-imposed austerity. On January 9th drivers of freight and passenger trains at Deutsche Bahn, the national railway, began a strike over working hours and pay.```
German translation:
```Die Proteste sollen offiziell durch die Entscheidung der Regierung ausgelöst worden sein, Subventionen für Dieselkraftstoff, der in der Landwirtschaft verwendet wird, einzustellen und eine Befreiung von der Kraftfahrzeugsteuer für landwirtschaftliche Fahrzeuge zu kürzen. Diese Maßnahmen brachten die Bauern zum Kippen. Es mobilisierte auch andere wütende Arbeiter, die bereits unter dem Druck von Inflation, Rezession und der selbstauferlegten Sparpolitik der Regierung litten. Am 9. Januar begannen Lokführer von Güter- und Personenzügen bei der Deutschen Bahn, einem nationalen Bahnunternehmen, einen Streik über Arbeitszeiten und Entlohnung.```

Minor:
style/awkward - ""Zum Kippen"" (idiomatic but slightly informal for a formal context)```","**Score: 66**

**Reasoning:**  
The translation captures most of the original meaning, with the exception of a key mistranslation in the first sentence. The phrase ""ostensibly set off by"" is misrendered as ""sollten offiziell"" (should be officially), which alters the nuance of the original. This is a **major error** affecting the accuracy of the translation. However, the rest of the text is accurately translated, with only a **minor style issue** (""Zum Kippen"" as an idiom, slightly informal for a formal context).

```Over the past decade, our lives have changed through technology, with many working from home, and Sydney has gained an impressive network of metro and light rail systems.

**Reasoning:**  
- **Major Errors (2):**  
  - ""gewonnen"" (win) instead of ""erlangen"" (gain) for ""gained"" is a critical mistranslation, affecting the intended meaning.  
  - ""bevorzugen"" (prefer) is slightly off in the context of ""preferencing heritage preservation,"" though it’s contextually acceptable.  

- **Minor Issues (2):**  
  - Punctuation in ""anstatt den Erhalt des Kulturerbes zu bevorzugen"" could be improved for fluency.  
  - ""in unserer gebauten Umgebung"" is awkward phrasing; ""gebauten"" is less natural than ""gebaute"" for ""built environment.""  

- **Overall Assessment:**  
  The translation preserves most of the original meaning (e.g., ""adaptive reuse,"" ""smartphone communication"") with only two major inaccuracies.

The hashtag format and structure are correct, and no grammatical errors exist. While ""Hausrenovierung"" is a valid term, the slight imprecision in ""Haus"" compared to ""Wohnung"" is a minor contextual issue, not a major error.

fluency/spelling - ""weißen haus"" (incorrect capitalization and genitive form; should be ""Weißen Haus"")```","**Score: 33**  
**Reasoning:**  
The translation contains a **major error** in the passive construction (""hat-wurde-unterstützt""), which alters the meaning by incorrectly combining ""hat"" (present tense) and ""wurde"" (past participle). This fundamentally changes the intended message. Additionally, **minor errors** include incorrect possessive (""von ireland guter freund"") and improper capitalization/genitive form (""weißen haus""). While some elements (e.g., URL structure) are correct, the major error significantly compromises meaning preservation, leading to a low score. The scale reflects ""Some meaning preserved"" (33), as the core message is distorted.",en-de

```In the air it's bumpy and floaty and feels like you're in a boat on the water. You have control, but sometimes a wave knocks you around a little bit, so u need to get your sea legs except in the air.```
German translation:
```In der Luft ist es rumpelig und schwebend und fühlt sich an, als wärst du in einem Boot auf dem Wasser. Du hast die Kontrolle, aber manchmal wirft dich eine Welle ein wenig hin und her, also musst du dir deine Seebeine zulegen - außer in der Luft.```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Seebeine"" (inappropriate for context, as ""Seebeine"" is a direct translation of ""sea legs"" but not the most natural term in German for this context)

Minor:
fluency/punctuation - ""außer in der Luft"" (hyphen before ""außer"" is unnecessary and slightly awkward)```","The translation captures the overall meaning of the original text, with most of the content accurately conveyed. The major error (""Seebeine"") is a direct translation that is not idiomatic in German, but the rest of the translation is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. The minor punctuation issue is negligible. While the mistranslation affects the naturalness of the term ""sea legs,"" the majority of the message is preserved, and the grammar is mostly correct.

**Reasoning:** The translation preserves the core meaning (the logbook being official and the time duration), though the structure of ""its log book official"" is rephrased to ""offiziell im Logbuch,"" which slightly alters the original phrasing but maintains the intended meaning. The minor fluency issue (""im Logbuch"") is negligible, and the grammar (e.g., comma in ""2,3"") is correct.

```Bring back oversight for WA's jails. Lives depend on it```
German translation:
```Bringen Sie die Aufsicht über die Gefängnisse von WA zurück. Menschenleben hängen davon ab```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
- **accuracy/mistranslation**: ""WA"" is correctly used as an abbreviation, but ""Gefängnisse"" (jails/prisons) is appropriate in context.  
- **fluency/punctuation**: The sentence structure is correct, but the use of ""davon"" in the second sentence is slightly awkward in this context.  

Minor:  
- **style/awkward**: ""davon"" in ""Menschenleben hängen davon ab"" is slightly less natural in this context, but still understandable.```","**Score: 66**  
**Reasoning**: The translation accurately conveys the core message (""Bring back oversight for WA's jails"" → ""Bringen Sie die Aufsicht über die Gefängnisse von WA zurück"") with correct use of ""WA"" as an abbreviation and ""Gefängnisse"" for ""jails."" The second sentence (""Lives depend on it"" → ""Menschenleben hängen davon ab"") is grammatically correct but has a minor style issue with ""davon,"" which is slightly awkward in this context. While the phrase is understandable, the slight awkwardness in ""davon"" is a minor flaw, and no major grammar or meaning errors exist.

German translation:

**Reasoning**:  
The translation contains multiple critical errors affecting meaning (e.g., ""floss"" instead of ""Fliegen,"" ""pa28"" → ""pa79,"" ""PilotTraining"" instead of ""Pilotenbildung""). While the structure (hashtags) is preserved, the content is largely mistranslated, leading to a loss of key meaning.

- **Major errors**: The addition of ""Kari Maddalena"" (a name not present in the source) and the complete misrepresentation of the source's actions (""Füge ihre Ambitionen und Heilung..."" instead of ""reviewing memories and curling up"") indicate that the translation fails to preserve the original meaning.  
- **Minor errors**: Grammatical issues (""dabei Füge"") and a misspelled word (""Sicherheiter"" → ""Sicherheit"") further degrade the quality, but these are secondary to the major mistranslations.  
- **Overall**: While the name is a minor addition, the core meaning is entirely misaligned with the source. This results in ""some meaning preserved"" (33), as only the name (a non-essential detail) is present, but the actions and context are completely incorrect.",en-de
