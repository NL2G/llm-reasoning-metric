- **Major Errors:**  
  1. **Terminology/Context:** ""Denuncias"" (complaints) is incorrectly used instead of ""reportes"" or ""informes"" (reports), altering the intended meaning.  
  2. **Spelling:** ""Desrusificar"" is misspelled; the correct term is ""desrussificar,"" which is critical for accuracy.  
- **Minor Error:** Missing space between ""intent"" and ""de"" in ""en un intento de desrusificar el país"" (fluency issue).

```The Department of Justice's overall approach to corporate crimes has come under intense scrutiny from advocates. While watchdogs have lauded some steps the department has taken during Merrick Garland's tenure as attorney general - like finally establishing a database on corporate crime - Biden's DOJ has also leaned heavily on leniency agreements that allow companies to defer or avoid prosecution, and encouraged companies to scapegoat individual employees so as to avoid a broader charge. Kenneth Polite Jr., former assistant attorney general for DOJ's Criminal Division, revised the division's corporate enforcement policy so as to limit prosecutions.```

**Rationale:**  
The Spanish translation preserves most of the meaning and structure of the original English text.

**Reasoning:**  
The translation has two key issues. The **major error** (""patrón del pez globo"" instead of ""patrulla del pez globo"") is a critical mistranslation that alters the meaning of the sentence, as ""patrulla"" (patrol) is essential to the context. The **minor error** (""se esconde en la arena"" instead of ""shimmies into the sand"") is a style choice that deviates from the original's nuance but does not significantly impact meaning. While the rest of the translation is accurate and grammatically correct, the major error reduces the overall meaning preservation.

fluency/punctuation - ""t,"" (extra comma not needed in Spanish)```","The translation has two major errors: ""t"" is incorrectly translated from ""tbf"" (a common English abbreviation for ""to be fair""), and ""fikn awesome"" is omitted entirely. These errors significantly disrupt the meaning of the original text. The minor issue of an extra comma in Spanish is negligible. While the Spanish translation ""t, la cerveza era"" is grammatically correct for the phrase ""the beer was,"" the original English text is riddled with errors (e.g., ""is was""). However, the translation fails to preserve the intended meaning due to the critical omissions and mistranslations.

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
**accuracy/mistranslation** - ""insinuación"" (flirting) and ""silbido"" (cat-calling) are inaccurate terms for the context. ""Insinuación"" implies innuendo, while ""silbido"" refers to whistling, not cat-calling.

The translation preserves most of the original meaning, with only two significant inaccuracies in vocabulary (""insinuación"" and ""silbido"" for ""flirting"" and ""cat-calling"").

Two major issues are the addition of ""de avión"" (unnecessary and incorrect) and the omission of ""departures,"" which is a critical term in the original text. These errors severely impact the accuracy of the translation. Additionally, the minor errors (""menor"" instead of ""menores"" and ""descomponer los accidentes"") further reduce fluency. While the core meaning is partially preserved, the critical omissions and inaccuracies lower the score substantially. 

**Score: 33**  
**Reasoning**: The translation fails to preserve most of the original meaning due to major errors (omission of ""departures"" and incorrect addition of ""de avión""). Minor errors add to the reduction in quality, but the primary issue is the significant loss of key information. This places it in the ""Some meaning preserved"" category (33).",en-es

accuracy/mistranslation - ""gafas de sol"" (sunglasses) instead of ""gafas de prescripción"" (prescription glasses) in the context of needing prescription glasses

This critical error significantly alters the meaning. The **minor error** is a stylistic awkwardness in the phrase ""pero si necesitas gafas de sol, son tan feas,"" which is understandable but slightly clunky.

```The Washington jail system is experiencing a fatality crisis. This is one of the uncomfortable but unavoidable truths we confronted as co-chairs of a legislative task force charged with studying our state's jail system and recommending changes to help make jails safer.

```Major:
accuracy/mistranslation - ""crisis de fatalidad"" (should be ""crisis de fallecimientos"" or ""crisis de muertes"")

Minor:
style/awkward - ""provenimos de una variedad de antecedentes"" (slightly awkward phrasing, but still understandable)```","**Score: 50**  
**Reasoning:**  
- **Major Errors:**  
  - ""crisis de fatalidad"" is incorrect; the intended term is ""crisis de fallecimientos"" or ""crisis de muertes"" (a critical mistranslation affecting the meaning).  
  - ""antecedentes"" is inappropriate; ""contextos"" or ""experiencias"" would better convey ""backgrounds"" (another significant terminology issue).  
  - These errors directly alter the meaning of the original text, reducing the overall accuracy.  

- **Minor Error:**  
  - ""provenimos de una variedad de antecedentes"" is awkward but understandable, which is a minor stylistic issue.  

- **Overall Assessment:**  
  The translation preserves most of the meaning but contains two major errors that impact core terminology. While the rest of the text is accurate, the critical mistranslations lower the score.
