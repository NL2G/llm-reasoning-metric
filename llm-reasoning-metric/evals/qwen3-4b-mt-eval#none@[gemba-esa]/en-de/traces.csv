```To create the antique brass ornament, I just went in with a coat of rub and buff onto the entire ornament there. And then of course, we have to get that antique look with the alcohol ink. So I went in with ginger first, I applied a droplet onto our ornament and just blended it out like so. And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and it looked really antique in like an actual metal ornament. After that, I did go in with a little bit more of that burnished amber spray paint as well to supply that to the surface, to kind of give it that oxidized look like we did for the bell ornaments. And that is how I finished off these antique brass bubbles. Really simple and easy, but honestly, they look like real metal and they're beautiful.```

Look’s like there's more than plenty of folks here.” I huffed out, I do not want to help with these drunks, but I feel bad making this guy work alone out here. “Could you?

Anton war gewöhnlich der einzige Mitarbeiter, somit wusste ich, dass er ziemlich gestresst sein musste. „Hey, Barkeeper, bring mir einen Kaffee.“ Ich sprach absichtlich mit tieferer Stimme, um ihn ein wenig durcheinanderzubringen. Ein kleines Kichern entglitt mir, als ich seinen Seufzer der Erleichterung wahrnahm, nachdem er sich schnell umgedreht hatte. „Gott, Lilith, tu mir das nicht an ...“, ließ er vernehmen, ersichtlich müde. „Du scheinst ziemlich beschäftigt zu sein ... Brauchst du Hilfe? Sieht danach aus, als wären hier mehr als genug Leute.“ Ich atmete kräftig aus. Ich will nicht bei diesen Betrunkenen aushelfen, doch ich fühle mich nicht gut dabei, diesen Kerl alleine hier arbeiten zu lassen. „Könntest du?

Okay, I need to check the German translation of the date and time from the English source. The source is ""JANUARY 19th, 2:34 PM, 2543."" The German translation is ""Am Freitag, 19. Januar, 22:34 Uhr, 2543.""

First, the date format. In German, the day comes before the month, so ""19. Januar"" is correct. But the original says ""JANUARY 19th,"" which is the month first, then the day. The German translation has the day first, which is correct in German, but the source is in English, so maybe the translation is correct in terms of the order.

Next, the time. The source is 2:34 PM, which in 24-hour time is 14:34. The German translation uses ""22:34 Uhr,"" which is 10:34 PM. That's a mistake. So that's a mistranslation of the time. That's a major error because it changes the time entirely.

Then, the day of the week. The source is ""JANUARY 19th,"" which is the 19th of January. The German translation is ""Am Freitag,"" which is ""On Friday."" But the 19th of January is not a Friday. The source doesn't mention the day of the week, but the German translation adds ""Am Freitag"" which is a mistranslation. The original source doesn't specify the day of the week, so adding that is an addition. However, the source is ""JANUARY 19th, 2:34 PM,"" which is the 19th of January at 2:34 PM. The German translation is ""Am Freitag, 19. Januar, 22:34 Uhr, 2543."" So ""Am Freitag"" is the day of the week, but the source doesn't mention that. So that's an addition, but it's not a mistranslation. Wait, the source is a date and time, but the day of the week is not in the source. The source is ""JANUARY 19th, 2:34 PM,"" which is the 19th of January at 2:34 PM, but the day of the week isn't specified. The German translation adds ""Am Freitag"" which is ""On Friday."" The source is in English, but the German translation is adding a day of the week that's not in the source.

Okay, I need to score the German translation of the English text ""JANUARY 19th, 2:34 PM, 2543."" The German translation is ""Am Freitag, 19. Januar, 22:34 Uhr, 2543."" The user provided annotated error spans, but I don't see any specific errors listed. The original source is in English, and the German translation is in German.

First, I should check if the German translation is accurate. The date ""19th January"" is correctly translated as ""19. Januar"" in German. The time ""2:34 PM"" is translated as ""22:34 Uhr,"" which is correct in 24-hour time. However, the original source is ""2:34 PM,"" which is 14:34 in 24-hour format, but the German translation is ""22:34 Uhr,"" which is 10:34 PM. That's a mistake. So that's a major error.

Next, the German translation starts with ""Am Freitag,"" which means ""On Friday."" The original source doesn't mention the day of the week. The original source is ""JANUARY 19th, 2:34 PM, 2543."" So the German translation adds ""Am Freitag,"" which is not in the original. That's an addition that's not part of the source. The source is in English, and the German translation is in German, so the addition of the day of the week is an error.

So, the German translation has two errors: the time is incorrect (2:34 PM is 14:34, but it's translated as 22:34), and the day of the week is added (Am Freitag) which is not in the source.

Now, the scoring: the scale is 0-100. The reference points are 0=""No meaning preserved"", 33=""Some meaning preserved"", 66=""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes"", 100=""Perfect meaning and grammar.""

The German translation has some meaning preserved, but there are two errors. The date is correct, but the time is wrong, and the day of the week is added. So the translation is mostly correct except for those two errors. The time is a major error, and the day of the week is an addition. So the score is probably 33 or 66. But since the date is correct, and the time is a major error, but the day of the week is an addition. The time is a major error, and the day of the week is an addition. So the score is 33.

**Explanation:**  
- **Major error (accuracy/mistranslation):** The source text ""feeldes"" refers to ""fields"" (a noun), but the German translation uses ""Gefühle"" (feelings), which is a mistranslation. The metaphor ""ploughing feelings"" is incorrect in the original context, as ""fields"" are literal land, not abstract emotions. This disrupts the intended meaning.  
- **No minor errors:** The grammar and structure of the German translation are correct, and the metaphor is preserved in the translation, though the literal meaning is misaligned.```","**Score: 33**

**Explanation:**  
The translation contains a major error in meaning (""feeldes"" → ""Gefühle""), which significantly alters the intended message.

**Reasoning:** The translation preserves most of the meaning and context from the original text. However, there are a few notable errors. ""Abwerfen"" is a major mistranslation; the intended meaning was ""to distract"" or ""to throw off,"" but ""abwerfen"" means ""to throw away"" or ""to dismiss,"" which is incorrect. ""Schnappte"" is also a mistranslation; it should be ""seufzte"" (sighed) to match the context of the character's sigh of relief. These are significant issues. Additionally, ""Sie"" is a minor fluency issue as it is used in a context where the speaker is addressing someone directly, not formally.

```We're just going to let that sit and rehydrate for a couple of minutes. With ultralight cooking, we're not actually cooking on this dough. We're primarily boiling water so that we can rehydrate our food. It's also one of the reasons why we use instant grits. less cooking time, less fuel and less weight. Oh yeah. So this is about what we've got going on here. Perfect consistency.```

```Wir lassen das jetzt ein paar Minuten stehen und rehydrieren. Beim Ultraleicht-Kochen kochen wir diesen Teig nicht wirklich. Wir kochen hauptsächlich Wasser, damit wir unser Essen rehydrieren können. Das ist auch einer der Gründe, warum wir Instant-Grits verwenden: weniger Kochzeit, weniger Brennstoff und weniger Gewicht. Oh ja. So sieht es also hier aus. Perfekte Konsistenz.```

accuracy/mistranslation - ""rehydrieren"" (correct, but ""rehydrate"" is the right term in context)  

Minor:  
style/awkward - ""so sieht es also hier aus"" (slightly informal but understandable)```","75

**Reasoning:** The translation generally preserves the meaning of the original text. However, there is a minor issue with the term ""rehydrieren"" which is a correct German word but not the most common or natural way to translate ""rehydrate"" in this context. The phrase ""so sieht es also hier aus"" is slightly informal but still understandable. These issues reduce the score from 100, but the translation is mostly accurate with few grammar mistakes.",en-de

**Reasoning:** The translation preserves most of the meaning and context, with only one major error (""Mitarbeiter der WPA"" instead of ""Mitarbeiter der EPA"") that affects accuracy but not overall understanding.
