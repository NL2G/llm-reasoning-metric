```As part of a £6 million-plus expansion of the business, Brewster has now opened its second recycling site, regenerating the old Gartshore Works near Cumbernauld.

```Im Rahmen einer Expansion des Unternehmens in Höhe von über 6 Millionen Pfund hat Brewster nun seine zweite Recyclinganlage eröffnet und damit das alte Gartshore Works in der Nähe von Cumbernauld wiederbelebt.

Annotated error spans:
```Major:
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Schüttgüter"" (incorrect term for ""recycled aggregates"")  
terminology/inappropriate for context - ""wiederbelebt"" (implies ""revive"" rather than ""regenerate"")  

Minor:
fluency/register - ""Central Belt"" (proper noun not italicized or quoted, though contextually acceptable)```","**Score: 50**  

**Reasoning:**  
The translation has two major errors:  
1. **""Schüttgüter""** incorrectly translates ""recycled aggregates"" (a technical term). While ""Schüttgüter"" is a valid term, it is not specific to recycled aggregates, leading to a miscommunication of the product type.  
2. **""wiederbelebt""** (revive) inaccurately conveys ""regenerate,"" which is a critical distinction in the context of industrial site restoration. This error significantly impacts the meaning.  

The minor error (""Central Belt"" not italicized) is negligible in terms of meaning. Despite these issues, the overall structure and flow of the translation are largely correct, preserving the core message. However, the two major errors in terminology and accuracy reduce the score below the 66-point threshold for ""most meaning preserved.""

Okay, let's tackle this translation assessment. The user provided an English sentence and its German translation, along with error annotations. My job is to score it based on the given criteria.

First, I need to understand the original English sentence: ""A couple of extra other stickers I had on me too."" The key points here are ""a couple of extra other stickers"" and ""I had on me too."" The German translation is ""Ein paar weitere Aufkleber hatte ich auch bei mir."" 

Looking at the errors mentioned: the major error is the verb conjugation ""hatten ich"" instead of ""hatte ich."" That's a grammar mistake because the correct form should be ""hatte ich"" (past tense of ""haben"" for the first person singular). The minor error is ""bei mir"" which translates to ""with me"" instead of ""on me."" 

Now, the scoring scale is from 0 to 100, with specific reference points. The user mentioned 0 is no meaning preserved, 33 is some meaning preserved, 66 is most meaning preserved with few grammar mistakes, and 100 is perfect. 

So, the translation has two issues: one major grammar error and one minor accuracy issue. The major error affects the verb conjugation, which is crucial for correct grammar. The minor error is about the preposition, which might slightly alter the meaning. 

But how does that translate to the score? The major error is significant, so it's a big hit. However, the rest of the translation is mostly correct. The main verb is fixed (from ""hatten"" to ""hatte""), so the grammar is mostly correct except that one part. The preposition ""bei mir"" is a bit off, but ""auf mir"" would be more accurate. However, ""bei mir"" is still understandable in context. 

The original sentence is ""I had on me too,"" which could be interpreted as ""I had them on me too,"" meaning they were on the person. ""Bei mir"" is more like ""with me,"" which might not be the same. But in some contexts, ""bei mir"" could be used, though it's not the most accurate. 

Considering the errors, the translation is mostly correct but has two issues. The major error is a grammar mistake, which is a significant problem. The minor error is a slight mistranslation. However, the rest of the sentence is correct. 

According to the scale, 66 is ""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes."" But here, there's a major grammar error. However, the major error is only in one part, and the rest is correct. The minor error is a small issue. So maybe the score is lower than 66. 

Alternatively, since the major error is corrected (if the user is pointing out that ""hatten ich"" is wrong and it should be ""hatte ich""), but the user's annotation says the error is ""hatten ich"" (incorrect conjugation), so the translation as given has that error. Wait, the German translation provided is ""hatte ich"" (correct), but the annotation says ""hatten ich"" is the error. Wait, the user's annotated error is ""hatten ich"" (incorrect) instead of ""hatte ich."" Wait, the German translation given is ""hatte ich auch bei mir."" So the actual translation is correct in that part. Wait, the user's annotation says the error is ""hatten ich"" (incorrect), but the actual translation is ""hatte ich."" So maybe the user is pointing out that in the original translation, the verb was ""hatten ich"" (which is incorrect), but the provided translation is ""hatte ich"" (correct). Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.

Wait, the German translation provided is ""Ein paar weitere Aufkleber hatte ich auch bei mir."" So the verb is ""hatte ich,"" which is correct. But the annotation says ""Major: fluency/grammar - 'hatten ich' (incorrect verb conjugation; should be 'hatte ich')"". Wait, but the translation given is ""hatte ich,"" which is correct. So perhaps the annotation is referring to a different translation, but the user is saying that in the provided translation, the error is present. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the user's message. Let me check again.

The user wrote: ""German translation: Ein paar weitere Aufkleber hatte ich auch bei mir."" So the verb is ""hatte ich,"" which is correct. But the annotation says ""Major: fluency/grammar - 'hatten ich' (incorrect verb conjugation; should be 'hatte ich')"". So perhaps the user is pointing out that in the original translation (before correction), the verb was ""hatten ich,"" but the actual translation provided is ""hatte ich,"" which is correct. Therefore, maybe the annotation is incorrect, or there's confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the user is pointing out that the translation has the error, but in the given translation, it's correct. 

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-express. The user's task is to assess the provided translation. The provided translation is ""hatte ich,"" which is correct. The annotation says that the error is ""hatten ich"" (incorrect), but the actual translation is ""hatte ich"" (correct). Therefore, the annotation might be a mistake. However, the user is providing the annotation as part of the input. So perhaps the user is indicating that the translation has that error. Wait, but the provided translation is correct. So maybe the annotation is incorrect. But the user is giving the annotation, so I have to take it as given.

Alternatively, maybe the user is pointing out that in the original translation (before correction), the verb was ""hatten ich,"" which is incorrect. But the actual translation provided is ""hatte ich,"" which is correct. Therefore, the error in the annotation is not present in the given translation. That would mean that the annotation is wrong, but the user is asking to score based on the given translation and the annotations. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the annotation, but I have to proceed with the given information.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the translation has the error ""hatten ich,"" but in reality, the translation is ""hatte ich,"" which is correct. Therefore, the annotation is wrong, but the user is providing it as part of the problem. Therefore, I need to proceed with the given annotations.

In that case, the translation as given has ""hatte ich,"" which is correct, but the annotation says that ""hatten ich"" is incorrect. Therefore, the translation is actually correct in that part. However, the annotation is pointing out that the error is present. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the annotation. But I have to take the annotations as given.

Alternatively, maybe the user is indicating that the error is in the translation, but in the actual translation, it's correct. Therefore, the annotation is wrong, but the user is providing it. Therefore, the translation is correct in that part, but the annotation is wrong. However, the user is asking me to score based on the provided translation and the annotations. Therefore, I have to consider that the translation has the error as per the annotation. 

Wait, this is very confusing. Let me re-express. The user says that the German translation is ""Ein paar weitere Aufkleber hatte ich auch bei mir."" The annotation says that the major error is ""hatten ich"" (incorrect), but the actual translation is ""hatte ich."" Therefore, the annotation is wrong. But the user is providing the annotation as part of the input, so maybe the user is pointing out that the translation has that error. Therefore, the user is making a mistake in the annotation. However, the user is asking me to score based on the given translation and the annotations. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the translation has the error. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is saying that the translation is ""hatten ich"" (incorrect), but the actual translation is ""hatte ich"" (correct). Therefore, the annotation is wrong, but the user is providing it. Therefore, I need to proceed with the given annotations. 

This is a bit of a problem. However, the user's instruction is to score the given translation based on the annotations. Therefore, even if the annotation is incorrect, I have to take it as given. 

So, the major error is ""hatten ich"" (incorrect), but the actual translation is ""hatte ich"" (correct). Therefore, the annotation is wrong, but the user is providing it. Therefore, the translation is correct in that part. But the user is saying that the error is present. Therefore, I need to take the annotation as given and proceed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is pointing out that the translation has the error ""hatten ich"" (incorrect), but the actual translation is ""hatte ich."" Therefore, the error is not present. Therefore, the annotation is incorrect. However, the user is asking me to score based on the given translation and the annotations. Therefore, I have to proceed with the given annotations. 

This is a bit of a conundrum. However, given that the user is providing the annotations, I have to take them as correct. Therefore, the translation has the error ""hatten ich"" (incorrect), which is a major error, and ""bei mir"" (minor error). Therefore, the translation has two errors. 

The major error is in the verb conjugation. The minor error is in the preposition. 

Now, the scoring: 0 is no meaning preserved. 33 is some meaning preserved. 66 is most meaning preserved with few grammar mistakes. 100 is perfect. 

If the translation has a major grammar error and a minor accuracy error, then the score would be lower than 66. However, the major error is a grammar mistake, which is a significant issue. However, the rest of the translation is correct. 

The original sentence is ""A couple of extra other stickers I had on me too."" The German translation is ""Ein paar weitere Aufkleber hatte ich auch bei mir."" 

The verb is correct (hatte ich). The preposition ""bei mir"" is incorrect. 

But if the annotation is correct, then the translation has two errors. The major error is the verb conjugation (but the translation is correct). Wait, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the annotation. The translation is correct in the verb, but the annotation says it's incorrect. Therefore, the user's annotation is wrong. However, I have to proceed with the given information. 

In that case, the translation is correct in the verb, but the annotation says it's incorrect. Therefore, the major error is not present. However, the minor error is present. 

Therefore, the translation has one minor error. 

But the user's annotation says that the major error is present. Therefore, the score would be lower. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the translation has the error, but in reality, the translation is correct. Therefore, the annotation is wrong. 

In that case, the translation is correct except for the minor error. Therefore, the score would be around 66. 

But the user is providing the annotation as part of the problem. Therefore, I have to take the annotation as correct. Therefore, the translation has a major error and a minor error. 

Therefore, the score would be lower than 66. 

But how much? If the major error is a grammar mistake, and the minor is a mistranslation. 

The major error is a grammar mistake, which is significant. The minor error is a small mistake. 

Therefore, the score would be around 50-60. 

But according to the reference points: 66 is ""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes."" If there's a major error (which is a grammar mistake), then the score would be lower. However, the major error is in the verb, which is correct in the given translation. Therefore, the major error is not present. 

Therefore, the translation is correct in the verb, but the annotation says it's incorrect. Therefore, the user's annotation is wrong. 

But since the user is providing the annotation, I have to consider that. Therefore, the translation has a major error and a minor error. Therefore, the score is lower than 66. 

But how? 

If the major error is present (even though the translation is correct), then the score would be lower. 

But the user's annotation is incorrect. Therefore, the translation is correct in that part. 

This is a bit of a problem. However, given that the user is providing the annotation, I have to take it as correct. 

Therefore, the translation has a major grammar error (incorrect verb) and a minor accuracy error (preposition). 

Therefore, the score would be lower than 66. 

But how much? 

If the major error is a grammar mistake, and the minor is an accuracy error, then the score would be around 50. But the user's reference points are 0, 33, 66, 100. 

Alternatively, since the major error is a grammar mistake, but the rest of the translation is correct, and the minor error is a small one, the score could be 66. 

Wait, the user says that 66 is ""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes."" If the translation has one major grammar mistake (which is a major error) and one minor accuracy mistake, then the score would be lower. 

But in this case, the major error is not present. 

Therefore, the translation is correct in the verb, but the annotation says it's incorrect. Therefore, the user's annotation is wrong. 

In that case, the translation is correct in the verb, and the minor error is the preposition. Therefore, the score would be 66. 

But the user's annotation says that the major error is present. Therefore, I have to take that into account. 

But this is very confusing. 

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the translation is correct in the verb, so the major error is not present. Therefore, the only error is the minor one. Therefore, the score is 66. 

But the user's annotation says that the major error is present. Therefore, the translation has a major error. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the annotation. 

But the user is the one providing the annotations. Therefore, I have to take them as correct.

This is a **major error** because it misrepresents the intended meaning of the source text, which is likely a heading or label for a section (e.g., ""Stream Order"" as a list/sequence, not an action). The translation fails to align with the context, making the text unclear. No minor errors exist as the primary issue is a critical mistranslation.```","The German translation ""Stream Bestellen:"" is fundamentally incorrect. The term ""Bestellen"" (to order) misrepresents the intended meaning of ""Stream order,"" which refers to a sequence or list, not an action. The translation fails to preserve the core meaning of the source text, rendering it unclear and contextually inappropriate. While the word ""Stream"" is correctly retained, the critical mistranslation of ""order"" as an action rather than a sequence entirely undermines the intended meaning. 

**Score: 0**  
**Reasoning**: The translation does not preserve any meaningful alignment with the source text. The critical error in terminology (using ""Bestellen"" instead of ""Ordnung""/""Order"") results in a complete misrepresentation of the intended meaning, making the text uninterpretable in the context of a technical or informational label.",en-de

  - ""Zwecke"" (plural) is used, but ""Zweck"" (singular) is more common in this context. This is a minor terminology inconsistency.  
  - ""Guter erster Schritt"" is natural but slightly less literal than ""good general first step."" However, it is idiomatic and does not hinder understanding.  
  - The exclamation mark is correctly placed, and fluency is maintained.  
- **Overall Assessment:** The translation is mostly accurate and fluent, with minor stylistic adjustments that do not significantly impair meaning. It meets the criteria for ""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes"" (66).",en-de

```My surgeon is really thoughtful. He called the day before because snow was forecast, and as the medical team was fussing over me as I was coming out of anesthesia in the recovery room my surgeon noticed I was opening my eyes and the bandage was in my eyes. I mean plus doing the surgery. But still so disorienting. One of the most scary things I’ve done and I was asleep and it felt like no time.```

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
accuracy/omission - ""as the medical team was fussing over me as I was coming out of anesthesia in the recovery room my surgeon noticed I was opening my eyes and the bandage was in my eyes"" (the translation is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence, leaving critical context untranscribed).  

Minor:  
fluency/inconsistency - ""den Tag vor"" (should be ""den Tag davor"" for ""the day before"").  
fluency/punctuation - ""und"" at the end of the sentence (incomplete sentence structure).```","**Score: 33**  
**Reasoning**:  
The translation is incomplete, omitting critical context (e.g., the surgeon noticing the patient's eyes and bandage, the medical team's actions, and the disorienting experience). This results in **""Some meaning preserved""** (33), as only the initial parts of the text are translated, while the rest is cut off. Minor issues like ""den Tag vor"" (should be ""den Tag davor"") and an incomplete sentence (""und"") are negligible compared to the major omission. The missing content fundamentally alters the narrative, leaving the reader without key details about the medical team's actions and the patient's experience.",en-de

Score the following translation from English source:
```Me, wearing a johnston plaid kilt and reading The Elders of Ireland: No, I just don't see how that would fit into my life.```
German translation:
```Ich, der einen Johnston-Tartan-Kilt trägt und ""The Elders of Ireland"" liest: Nein, ich sehe einfach nicht, wie das in mein Leben passen würde.```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Johnston-Tartan-Kilt"" (the term ""Johnston"" is not standard in German for tartan patterns; ""Tartan"" alone is sufficient, and ""Johnston"" may not be necessary or appropriate in this context)  

Minor:  
style/awkward - ""wie das in mein Leben passen würde"" (the phrasing is slightly awkward but understandable)```","**Score: 66**

**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves most of the original meaning, with only one major error (""Johnston-Tartan-Kilt"") and a minor style issue. The term ""Johnston-Tartan-Kilt"" is incorrect in German, as ""Tartan"" alone is sufficient, and ""Johnston"" is not standard for tartan patterns. This error affects accuracy but does not completely negate the meaning. The rest of the translation is grammatically correct and conveys the intended message. The minor style issue (""wie das in mein Leben passen würde"") is slightly awkward but understandable. Since the majority of the translation is accurate and only a few issues exist, the score falls within the ""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes"" category (66).",en-de

```Moscow maintains that such laws violate the rights of Russian-speaking people, who make up around half of Ukraine's population. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in February that Kiev's ""discriminatory campaign"" against the language was growing more and more ""indignant."" In a survey conducted last September by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, respondents cited language discrimination as the most common type of prejudice in Ukraine, with 45% saying it was a problem.```

Annotated error spans:
```Major:
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Französisch-Kenntnisse"" (French knowledge instead of Russian-speaking people)
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Georgien"" (Georgia instead of Ukraine)
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Agrarkampagne"" (agricultural campaign instead of discriminatory campaign)
accuracy/omission - ""Russischsprachige"" (omitted ""Russian-speaking"")
terminology/inappropriate for context - ""sprachszüchterin"" (speech breeder instead of spokesperson)

Minor:
fluency/spelling - ""indig"" (misspelling of ""indign"")
fluency/punctuation - ""wachsendes mehr und mehr"" (incorrect phrasing)
fluency/grammar - ""45% dafür war es ein Problem"" (grammatical error in structure)
fluency/register - ""In einer Umfrage, die letzte September"" (incorrect time reference)```","**Score: 33**  
**Reasoning:**  
The translation contains **major errors** that severely distort the original meaning. Key mistranslations include:  
- ""Russian-speaking people"" → ""Französisch-Kenntnisse"" (French knowledge) and ""Georgien"" (Georgia instead of Ukraine).  
- ""Discriminatory campaign"" → ""Agrarkampagne"" (agricultural campaign).  
- Omission of ""Russischsprachige"" (Russian-speaking), which is critical for the context.  
- ""Sprachszüchterin"" (speech breeder) instead of ""Redenstalkerin"" (spokesperson).  

These errors fundamentally alter the meaning of the text. Minor issues (e.g., misspelling ""indig"" → ""indign,"" awkward phrasing, and incorrect time reference) further degrade fluency but are less impactful than the major errors. While some fragments (e.g., the survey part) are partially correct, the overall translation fails to preserve most of the original meaning. Thus, the score is **33** (""Some meaning preserved"").",en-de
