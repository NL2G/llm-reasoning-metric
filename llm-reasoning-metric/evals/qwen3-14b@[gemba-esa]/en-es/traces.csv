The Spanish translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly captures the informal tone of the original question (""What woke you guys up?""), using ""chicos"" for ""guys"" and ""os"" for the informal plural ""you."" The punctuation (question mark inside the quotation marks) and structure (""- ¿...? -preguntó Cohren"") are appropriate for Spanish dialogue conventions. No errors are present.```","**Score: 100**  
The Spanish translation is flawless in both meaning and grammar. It accurately preserves the informal tone of the original question (""What woke you guys up?"") using ""chicos"" for ""guys"" and ""os"" for the plural informal ""you"" (common in Spanish-speaking regions like Spain). The dialogue formatting (- ¿...? -preguntó Cohren) adheres to Spanish conventions, and punctuation (question mark placement) is correct.

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
accuracy/mistranslation - ""Domingos"" (incorrect plural form; ""Sunday"" should be singular ""Domingo"" in Spanish unless explicitly referring to multiple Sundays)  

Minor:  
none identified  

**Explanation**:  
- **""Domingos""** is a major error because ""Sunday"" in the source is singular (""Sunday Cont.""), but the translation uses the plural ""Domingos,"" which changes the intended meaning (e.g., referring to a specific Sunday vs. Sundays in general).  
- The abbreviation ""Cont."" is retained as-is, which is acceptable in some contexts (e.g., ""Continuation"" in Spanish is often abbreviated as ""Cont."" in formal or technical writing). No other errors are evident.```","**Score: 33**  

**Reasoning:**  
The translation incorrectly pluralizes ""Sunday"" as ""Domingos,"" which fundamentally alters the meaning from a singular reference (e.g., a specific Sunday) to a general plural reference (e.g., Sundays in general). This is a **major mistranslation** that compromises the core meaning. While the abbreviation ""Cont."" is preserved without issue, the singular-to-plural error renders the translation misleading or ambiguous in context. Since only ""some meaning"" is preserved (the reference to Sundays, albeit in the wrong grammatical form), the score aligns with the ""33"" reference point.",en-es

La criatura parecía saber exactamente dónde Thassalin había caído y se dirigió directamente hacia él, llevándose la nube oscura consigo.```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:
- **No major errors identified.** The translation accurately conveys the source text's meaning without disrupting flow or understandability.

Minor:
- **terminology/inappropriate for context** – ""línea de árboles"" (literal ""tree line"") instead of a more idiomatic or natural Spanish equivalent like ""línea arbórea"" or ""frontera de árboles"" (though ""línea de árboles"" is still understandable and contextually acceptable).  
- **style/awkward** – ""llevándose la nube oscura consigo"" (literal ""taking the dark cloud with it"") could be phrased more naturally as ""llevándose la nube oscura"" (omitting ""consigo"" for smoother flow, though the original phrasing is not incorrect).

**Rationale:**  
The translation preserves the full meaning of the source text with no major errors, ensuring clarity and coherence. Minor issues (e.g., ""línea de árboles"" vs. a more idiomatic term, and the slightly awkward ""llevándose la nube oscura consigo"") are stylistic or terminological preferences rather than errors in grammar or meaning. These do not disrupt understanding or the flow of the text, and the overall translation is fluent, accurate, and maintains the original tone.

```Ivory approached the door that was just as intricate as Kari’s. On it was the White Dragon, one of the 6 primordial dragons, who allegedly created Frostfell. It would make sense for the painter to have it on his door though, he liked history.```
Spanish translation:
```Marfil se acercó a la puerta que era igual de intrincada que la de Kari. En ella estaba el Dragón Blanco, uno de los 6 dragones primordiales, que supuestamente creó Frostfell. Tendría sentido que el pintor lo tuviera en su puerta, ya que le gustaba la historia.```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
**accuracy/mistranslation** - ""ya que"" (translated as ""since"" instead of ""though,"" altering the nuance of the original contrast).  

Minor:  
**style/awkward** - ""lo tuviera"" (subjunctive form is correct, but the phrasing ""Tendría sentido que el pintor lo tuviera en su puerta"" is slightly awkward in Spanish, though still understandable).  

**No other errors identified.**  

### Explanation:  
- **Major (accuracy/mistranslation):** The conjunction ""though"" in the original (""though, he liked history"") is translated as ""ya que"" (since), which changes the intended contrast to a cause-effect relationship. This alters the nuance but doesn't render the text incomprehensible.  
- **Minor (style/awkward):** The phrase ""Tendría sentido que el pintor lo tuviera en su puerta"" is grammatically correct but feels slightly formal or awkward in Spanish. A more natural phrasing might be ""Tendría sentido que el pintor tuviera esa imagen en su puerta,"" but the meaning remains clear.  

No other errors in accuracy, fluency, terminology, or punctuation are present.```","**Score: 70**  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Major Error (accuracy/mistranslation):** The translation of ""though"" as ""ya que"" (since) introduces a cause-effect relationship instead of the intended contrast (""though he liked history""). While the overall meaning is preserved (the painter's interest in history justifies the image), the nuance shift affects the logical flow. This is a significant error but doesn't render the text incomprehensible.  
- **Minor Error (style/awkwardness):** The phrase ""Tendría sentido que el pintor lo tuviera en su puerta"" is grammatically correct but feels slightly awkward or overly formal. This is a minor stylistic issue that doesn’t impede understanding.  
- **Overall Assessment:** Most meaning is preserved, but the major error affects the nuance of the contrast, and the minor error introduces a slight awkwardness. The translation is mostly fluent and accurate, but the nuance shift reduces the score from the ""most meaning preserved"" threshold (66) to 70, reflecting the impact of the major error on interpretation.",en-es

**accuracy/mistranslation** - ""Traer la supervisión de nuevo"" (literal translation of ""Bring back oversight"" is awkward and unnatural in Spanish; ""restablecer la supervisión"" or ""volver a implementar la supervisión"" would be more idiomatic).  

Minor:  
**style/awkward** - ""Traer la supervisión de nuevo"" (awkward phrasing; ""restablecer"" or ""volver a implementar"" would flow better).

No other errors detected. The translation is mostly understandable but lacks fluency in phrasing.```","**Score: 70**  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Major error** (""Traer la supervisión de nuevo"" instead of ""restablecer/volver a implementar"") affects the naturalness and idiomatic expression of the phrase, but the core meaning (""bring back oversight"") is still preserved.  
- **Minor errors** relate to stylistic awkwardness (""de nuevo"" and ""de ello""), which do not impede understanding but reduce fluency.  
- The translation is mostly comprehensible, with the key message intact, though the phrasing feels less natural in Spanish. This aligns with a score in the mid-70s, reflecting preserved meaning with notable stylistic issues.",en-es

- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""veinte y dieciocho"" (28) instead of ""2018"" (dos mil dieciocho)  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""rechazar esto"" (reject this) instead of ""turn this down"" (reduce this)  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""un tiro rápido de pegamento"" (a quick shot of glue) instead of ""a quick little glue job""

- **accuracy/omission** - missing specification of units for ""95"" (e.g., ""95 grados"")  
- **fluency/grammar** - ""puedas quitar el calor"" (you can remove the heat) with subject-verb agreement error (should be ""pueda quitar"")  
- **terminology/inappropriate for context** - ""cuarto trasero"" (fourth back) instead of ""back quarter"" (likely intended as ""parte trasera"" or ""cuarto trasero"" as a technical term, but ambiguous)  

**Note**: The translation contains multiple major errors that significantly alter the meaning (e.g., ""rechazar"" instead of ""turn down,"" incorrect year). The ""tiro rápido de pegamento"" is also a major mistranslation, as it implies a literal ""shot of glue"" rather than a repair process. Minor errors include grammatical issues and missing context (units for ""95"").```","**Score: 33**  

**Reasoning:**  
The translation contains **three major errors** that significantly alter key aspects of the meaning:  
1. **""veinte y dieciocho""** instead of **""dos mil dieciocho""** (2018 → 28), which completely misrepresents the vehicle's year.  
2. **""rechazar esto""** (reject this) instead of **""turn this down""** (reduce the heat), which changes the intended action from adjusting temperature to rejecting something.  
3. **""un tiro rápido de pegamento""** (a quick shot of glue) instead of **""a quick little glue job""**, which misinterprets the repair process as a literal ""shot"" rather than a repair action.  

These errors undermine the core message (e.g., the year of the car, the heat adjustment, and the repair task). While **minor errors** (omitted units, grammar, terminology ambiguity) exist, they are secondary to the major issues. The translation preserves **some meaning** (e.g., mentions of the dent, glue being hot, and the speaker’s intent to fix it), but the critical details are distorted.

```So either there's something wrong with this panel or my multimeter, or they changed the listing.```
Spanish translation:
```Entonces, o hay algo mal con este panel o mi multímetro, o cambiaron la información en la lista.```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
**accuracy/addition** - ""información en la lista"" (untranslated addition of ""information in the"" which is not present in the original ""the listing""). This alters the meaning by specifying ""information in the list"" instead of simply ""the list,"" potentially confusing the intended reference (e.g., a catalog, specification list, or database).  

Minor:  
**style/awkward** - The repetition of ""o"" three times (""o hay... o mi... o cambiaron..."") is grammatically correct in Spanish but may feel slightly verbose or awkward in context. However, it does not impede understanding.  

**Note**: The translation of ""the listing"" as ""la información en la lista"" introduces a minor ambiguity, but the core meaning of ""they changed the listing"" is preserved. The primary issue is the unnecessary addition of ""información en,"" which is a major accuracy error.```","**Score: 66**  

**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves the core meaning of the original sentence: the speaker is suggesting one of three possibilities (a problem with the panel/multimeter or a change in the listing). However, the **major accuracy error**—adding ""información en"" to ""la lista"" (translating ""the listing"" as ""information in the list"" instead of simply ""the list"")—introduces ambiguity and alters the intended reference. This addition could mislead the reader into thinking the listing contains ""information"" rather than being a direct reference to a specific list (e.g., a catalog, database, or specification sheet).  

While the **minor style issue** (repetition of ""o"") is grammatically correct and does not impede understanding, the major error significantly impacts clarity and accuracy. The note clarifies that the core meaning is preserved, but the unnecessary addition of ""información en"" is a critical flaw.

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
**accuracy/mistranslation** - ""los delanteros del infierno"" (literal translation of ""Frontrunners"" as ""delanteros,"" which is sports-specific and may not align with the intended meaning of ""Frontrunners"" as a team name or nickname).  

Minor:  
**terminology/inappropriate for context** - ""delanteros"" (sports-related term may not reflect the intended metaphorical or team-specific meaning of ""Frontrunners"").  

**Explanation**:  
- The phrase ""Hell’s Frontrunners"" is likely a proper noun (e.g., a team name or nickname). Translating ""Frontrunners"" as ""delanteros"" (literally ""forwards"" in sports) introduces ambiguity, as it shifts the meaning from a metaphorical or group identifier to a sports-specific term. This could mislead readers unfamiliar with the context.  
- While the rest of the translation is fluent and grammatically correct, the mistranslation of ""Frontrunners"" disrupts the intended meaning, making it a **major** error. The use of ""delanteros"" is **inappropriate for context** as a team name, further classifying it as a **minor** terminology error.```","**Score: 65**  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Major Error (Frontrunners → ""delanteros"")**: The mistranslation of ""Frontrunners"" as ""delanteros"" (sports-specific term) significantly alters the intended meaning, as it shifts from a likely team name/nickname to a literal sports term. This disrupts the context and could confuse readers unfamiliar with the source material, making it a critical flaw.  
- **Minor Error (Terminology)**: The use of ""delanteros"" is inappropriate for a team name, further complicating the translation’s accuracy.  
- **Rest of the Translation**: The grammar, syntax, and other phrases (e.g., ""risa seca,"" ""¿Dónde nos envían?"") are fluent and correct.  

While the majority of the translation is grammatically sound and preserves much of the original structure, the core error in ""Frontrunners"" undermines the meaning, warranting a score in the ""Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes"" range (66) but slightly adjusted downward due to the significant impact of the mistranslation.",en-es

**Explanation:**  
The translation incorrectly pluralizes ""the only person"" as ""las únicas personas,"" which changes the meaning from singular to plural.

**Reasoning:**  
The translation contains a **major accuracy/mistranslation error** by pluralizing ""the only person"" as ""las únicas personas,"" which fundamentally alters the grammatical number and likely the intended meaning (singular vs. plural).

**style/awkward** - ""miel, un amplio grupo demográfico"" (awkward phrasing; ""miel"" is out of context and disrupts the flow).

**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves the core promotional message (email, packages, demographics) and most grammatical structures, but two **major errors** significantly impact clarity and meaning:  
1. **""miel""** (literal translation of ""honey"") is nonsensical in a professional context, disrupting the intended tone and potentially confusing the audience.  
2. **""Anunciado conmigo hoy""** uses the wrong verb form (past participle instead of imperative), undermining the persuasive, direct tone of the original.

The price of bitcoin has exploded higher in recent months, rising from around $25,000 in September to more than $45,000, in part because many bitcoin investors believe the ETFs will create more demand for the asset.```

**Explanation:**  
The Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English source text. Key terms like ""watershed event"" are translated as ""evento decisivo,"" which is contextually appropriate. Numerical data (""$25,000"" to ""$45,000"") and financial terminology (""ETFs,"" ""cryptocurrencies"") are preserved correctly. The structure of the sentences aligns with the source, and the flow of ideas is coherent. No additions, omissions, or mistranslations disrupt the message. The use of ""pasando de"" (passing from) is natural in this context and does not constitute an error. The translation is both accurate and fluent.```","The Spanish translation is flawless in both meaning preservation and grammatical accuracy. Key terms are rendered appropriately (e.g., ""watershed event"" → ""evento decisivo""), numerical data is retained precisely, and financial terminology is correctly preserved. Sentence structure aligns with the source, and the flow is natural and coherent. No errors—major or minor—are present.

Sighing, I placed my hands on the system in front of me, emanating a red and purple glow – I could hack the security, the place isn’t far, and I doubt they took measures...Maybe I shouldn’t. Of course, against all morals, my fingers moved without my knowing, pulling up multiple screens; god I’m good. I was pretty popular on a couple of websites, they referred to me as “WRAITH.” Which was a pretty catchy name.

**Rationale:**  
- **Major errors** significantly impact meaning:  
  - The use of **""aunque""** instead of **""pero""** alters the contrastive nuance of ""But Craith..."" (e.g., ""although"" implies a concession, while ""pero"" is a direct contrast).  
  - The mistranslation of **""it couldn’t have been two years ago""** to **""no podía haber transcurrido más de dos años""** reverses the intended meaning (the original implies the time is shorter than two years, while the translation suggests it could have been up to two years). These errors undermine key aspects of the narrative.  

- **Minor errors** are negligible in terms of comprehension:  
  - The unnecessary comma after **""en la Tierra""** is a minor fluency issue.  
  - Retaining **""NCO""** as an acronym is contextually acceptable in military jargon, though not ideal for general readability.

```The problems at the EPA are distinct but not unrelated to those at the Department of Justice, which handles environmental crimes via its Environment and Natural Resources Division, or ENRD. Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well. As the Environmental Integrity Project notes, even Trump's EPA concluded 94 civil cases and deferred 106 cases per year to the DOJ per year, on average.```

```**Major Errors:**  
- **None identified.** The translation accurately conveys the original content without disrupting the flow or making the text incomprehensible.  

**Minor Errors:**  
1. **Terminology/inappropriate for context** – *""desconectados""* (translated as ""not unrelated""). While ""desconectados"" is grammatically correct, it slightly overemphasizes the contrast compared to the original ""not unrelated,"" which is a minor terminological choice.  
2. **Terminology/inconsistent use** – *""División de Recursos Naturales y Medioambientales""* (translated as ""Environment and Natural Resources Division""). The order of terms in Spanish (""Recursos Naturales y Medioambientales"") differs from the English original (""Environment and Natural Resources""), but this is a common and acceptable variation in Spanish terminology.

**Rationale:**  
- **Major Errors (Significant Impact on Meaning):**  
  1. **""directamente bitcoin""** (missing verb ""invest in"" or ""deal with"") renders the sentence **grammatically incomplete** and **ambiguous**, losing the intended action of converting the fund to directly engage with Bitcoin. This is a **critical mistranslation** that alters the core message of the sentence.  
  2. **Omission of ""would""** in ""would directly bitcoin"" changes the **conditional structure** to a direct statement, misrepresenting the legal nuance of the court’s ruling. This affects the **accuracy** of the conditional intent.  

- **Minor Errors (Less Impact on Meaning):**  
  1. **""Tribunal de Apelación""** vs. **""Tribunal de Apelaciones""**: A **terminology/grammar** error (singular vs. plural), but the meaning of the institution is still clear.  
  2. **Awkward phrasing** (""directamente bitcoin"") is redundant with the major error and does not add new issues beyond what is already addressed.  

- **Overall Assessment:**  
  The **core meaning** of the SEC’s actions and the court’s ruling is preserved, but the **critical details about the fund’s conversion** are **obscured** due to major errors.

It wouldn't be the air so much as the water that would be heavily polluted, and it would be the very water used to douse the flames that would caused the disaster. The highly toxic mercury compounds were present as fungicides in sea dressings in the warehouse, and were marked with fluorescent red dye Rhodamine B.```

No sería tanto el aire como el agua lo que estaría fuertemente contaminado, y sería el mismo agua utilizada para apagar las llamas lo que causaría el desastre.

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""revestimientos marinos"" (if ""sea dressings"" refers to a specific product or term, this may be an incorrect translation; without context, it's ambiguous but could be a mistranslation).  
- **accuracy/omission** - ""sea dressings"" (the term is translated as ""revestimientos marinos,"" but if the original term has a specific meaning not captured by this translation, it could be an omission or mistranslation).  

Minor:  
- **terminology/inappropriate for context** - ""El cercano Basil"" (using ""cercano"" as an adjective before a proper noun is awkward; ""Basil cercano"" or rephrasing for clarity would be better).  
- **style/awkward** - ""No sería tanto el aire como el agua lo que estaría fuertemente contaminado"" (the structure is grammatically correct but slightly wordy and less idiomatic in Spanish).  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""Faustmanning"" (if this is a proper noun or technical term that should remain in English or be localized, the direct translation may be inappropriate).  

**Note:** The translation of ""Faustmanning"" is ambiguous. If it is a proper noun (e.g., a brand or chemical compound), keeping it as ""Faustmanning"" is acceptable. If it is a mistranslation of a different term, that would be a major error. Similarly, ""sea dressings"" may require context to determine if ""revestimientos marinos"" is accurate.```","**Score: 75/100**

**Rationale:**  
The translation preserves the core meaning of the original text, including the emergency alert, advice to locals, pollution sources, and toxic mercury compounds. However, the annotated errors introduce notable issues:  

- **Major errors** (potential ambiguity):  
  - *""revestimientos marinos""* for *""sea dressings""* is a critical point. Without context, this term might be a mistranslation (e.g., ""sea dressings"" could refer to a specific product like antifouling coatings or packaging materials, which ""revestimientos marinos"" does not clearly capture). This could obscure technical accuracy.  
  - *""Faustmanning""* is left untranslated, which is acceptable if it is a proper noun, but the ambiguity raises concerns about whether it should remain in English or require localization.  

- **Minor errors**:  
  - *""El cercano Basil""* is awkward but does not distort meaning.  
  - The sentence structure *""No sería tanto el aire como el agua lo que estaría fuertemente contaminado""* is grammatically correct but stylistically wordy.  

While the translation avoids major grammatical errors and retains most meaning, the potential mistranslations of key terms (*""sea dressings""*, *""Faustmanning""*) and the ambiguity around their accuracy reduce the score from a high 80s.

The translation contains a **major accuracy error** in the core idiom ""get my hopes up,"" which is mistranslated as ""make my hopes fade,"" completely inverting the intended meaning.

On the scale:  
- **0** (""No meaning preserved"") is too harsh, as some structural and contextual elements are retained.  
- **33** (""Some meaning preserved"") reflects that the translation captures parts of the message (e.g., the speaker’s caution, the reference to ""last time"") but **fails to convey the critical nuance** of the idiom, leading to a misinterpretation of the speaker’s intent.

Minor:
terminology/inappropriate for context - ""CR"" (abbreviation for ""Continuing Resolution"" is left untranslated without context, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term)
fluency/register - ""esperanzadamente"" (placement of the adverb ""esperanzadamente"" creates an awkward flow; ""esperanzadamente, todos estarán motivados..."" would be more natural)```","**Score: 75**  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Major Error (""volver a sus sentidos""):** The phrase is a literal translation of ""come to their senses,"" which is awkward and less idiomatic in Spanish. While the core meaning (regaining clarity/reason) is preserved, the unnatural phrasing affects fluency and slightly diminishes the intended nuance. This is a significant issue but doesn't erase the meaning.  
- **Minor Errors:**  
  - **""CR"" abbreviation:** Leaving ""Continuing Resolution"" untranslated risks confusion for unfamiliar readers, but the context (political/governmental) might imply understanding. This is a terminology oversight but doesn’t severely impact meaning.  
  - **""esperanzadamente"" placement:** The adverb’s awkward positioning disrupts flow but doesn’t alter the message. A minor fluency issue.  

**Overall:** The translation preserves the majority of the original meaning and structure, with the major error affecting fluency and nuance rather than comprehension. Minor issues further reduce quality but are less critical. A score of **75** reflects mostly preserved meaning with notable but not catastrophic errors.",en-es

```No, clearly not. The creature just hissed and tried to fly directly into Thassalin. Thankfully, despite his size, Thassalin was nimble enough to get out of the way, but Nyssi couldn't help but scream as she very nearly lost her grip on Thassalin's overly smooth scales.```
Spanish translation:
```No, claramente no. La criatura simplemente gruñó y se dirigió directamente hacia Thassalin. Afortunadamente, a pesar de su tamaño, Thassalin fue lo suficientemente ágil como para alejarse de su camino, pero Nyssi no pudo evitar gritar al casi perder el agarre de las escalas demasiado suaves de Thassalin.```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""gruñó"" (growled) instead of ""hissed"" (siseó). This changes the creature's action, altering the intended meaning.  
- **accuracy/omission** - Missing ""tried to fly"" (intentó volar). The translation omits the verb ""tried,"" which is critical to conveying the creature's attempt.  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""se dirigió directamente hacia Thassalin"" (directed directly toward Thassalin) instead of ""tried to fly directly into Thassalin."" The translation misrepresents the action and omits the ""fly"" component.  

Minor:  
- **fluency/grammar** - ""alejarse de su camino"" (get out of their way). The preposition ""de"" is slightly awkward here; ""alejarse del camino"" (get out of the way) would be more natural, though the meaning remains clear.  

---

**Explanation:**  
- The mistranslation of ""hissed"" as ""gruñó"" (growled) is a major error because it changes the creature's behavior from a hiss to a growl, which could alter the narrative's tone.  
- The omission of ""tried to fly"" removes a key detail about the creature's action, making the sentence less precise.  
- The mistranslation of ""tried to fly directly into"" as ""se dirigió directamente hacia"" misses the verb ""tried"" and the nuance of ""into"" (hacia vs. dentro de).  
- The preposition in ""alejarse de su camino"" is a minor grammatical issue but does not significantly impair understanding.```","**Score: 50**  

**Rationale:**  
The translation suffers from **three major errors** that significantly alter the meaning and nuance of the original text:  
1. **""gruñó"" (growled)** instead of **""siseó"" (hissed)**: This changes the creature's behavior from a subtle, threatening hiss to a more aggressive growl, altering the tone and intent of the action.  
2. **Omission of ""tried to fly""**: The critical verb ""intentó volar"" is missing, leaving the creature's action incomplete and less precise. The phrase ""se dirigió directamente hacia"" (directed directly toward) misrepresents the original ""tried to fly directly into,"" omitting both the attempt and the verb ""fly.""  
3. **Misuse of ""hacia"" instead of ""dentro de""**: The translation fails to capture the nuance of ""into"" (dentro de) versus ""toward"" (hacia), which affects the spatial relationship in the scene.  

While the **minor grammatical issue** with ""alejarse de su camino"" is negligible and does not impede understanding, the **major errors** compromise the accuracy of key actions and the creature's intent. The overall meaning is **partially preserved** but significantly distorted in critical details, falling below the ""most meaning preserved"" threshold (66).

**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves the full meaning of the original text with no major errors. The only issues are minor:  
1. **Grammar:** ""del"" instead of ""de la"" in ""la mayoría **del** habla natural"" (feminine noun *habla* requires ""de la""). This is a small grammatical inaccuracy but does not significantly affect comprehension.  
2. **Style:** The phrase ""la mayoría del habla"" is slightly awkward compared to the more natural ""la mayor parte del habla,"" though this is a stylistic preference rather than an error.  

The translation is fluent, accurate, and retains the intended message, with only trivial adjustments needed. The minor issues are negligible in practical use and do not detract from the overall quality. A score of 95 reflects near-perfect execution with minimal, non-critical flaws.",en-es

Minor:
none

**Explanation:**  
The source and translation are identical HTML code. However, HTML tags (e.g., `<div id=sec2></div>`) are not meant to be translated. Attempting to translate them is a **non-translation error** because the content is technical and requires no linguistic processing. This is a **major error** because translating such code could lead to functional issues (e.g., broken website structure). No minor errors are present since the translation is technically identical to the source, but the context of translation is entirely incorrect.```","The translation is technically identical to the source HTML code. However, the key issue is that **HTML tags should never be translated**, as they are technical markup elements, not language-dependent text. The system correctly left the HTML unchanged, which is the appropriate action. 

**Scoring rationale**:  
- **Major error**: The explanation claims this is a ""non-translation error"" because the HTML was not translated, but in reality, the system did the correct thing by not translating it. The error annotation is contradictory—leaving HTML unchanged is *not* an error.  
- **Minor errors**: None.  
- **Meaning preservation**: The HTML structure is preserved, but the task of translating text was irrelevant here.

**Rationale:**  
- **Major Errors:**  
  - The mistranslation of ""craft"" as ""técnica"" (technique) instead of a more idiomatic term like ""arte"" or ""habilidad"" (artistry/skill) affects the nuance of the original meaning, which refers to the author's skill or artistry in writing. This is a significant meaning loss.  
  - The awkward phrasing ""proceso de madurar"" (process of maturing) is unnatural in Spanish; ""parte del crecimiento"" (part of growing up) would better preserve the conversational tone of the original.

  - ""Ignorantes de sus necesidades emocionales"" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward compared to alternatives like ""desconocedores"" or ""ciegos,"" which better capture the nuance of ""ignorant to their emotional needs.""

Minor:  
**fluency/awkward** - ""llevándose consigo"" (redundant reflexive pronoun ""consigo"" when ""llevándose"" already implies ""with it"")  

**Explanation**:  
- **""arboleda""** mistranslates ""treeline"" as a dense forest or grove, whereas ""treeline"" refers specifically to the line of trees at the edge of a forest, which might be better translated as ""línea de árboles"" or ""frontera de árboles.""  
- **""llevándose consigo la nube oscura""** includes the reflexive pronoun ""consigo,"" which is redundant because ""llevándose"" (taking with itself) already implies ""with it."" This makes the phrase slightly awkward but still understandable.  
- No other major errors disrupt comprehension. The translation is otherwise fluent and contextually appropriate.```","**Score: 66**

**Rationale:**  
The translation preserves the core meaning of the original text, with the creature's actions and the sequence of events clearly conveyed. However, two major errors affect accuracy:  
1. **""arboleda""** (dense forest/grove) misrepresents ""treeline"" (edge of a forest), which could be better translated as ""línea de árboles"" or ""frontera de árboles."" This alters the specific imagery but doesn't entirely disrupt comprehension.  
2. **""llevándose consigo la nube oscura""** includes a redundant reflexive pronoun (""consigo""), making the phrase awkward despite being understandable.  

The minor fluency issue (""consigo"") is a stylistic redundancy, not a comprehension barrier. The rest of the translation is fluent, grammatically correct, and contextually appropriate.

Es una ciudad que divide opiniones debido a su arquitectura más moderna y urbana. Róterdam fue casi completamente destruida durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial cuando los alemanes atacaron la ciudad. Debido a esto, la ciudad tuvo que ser reconstruida, lo que resultó en una apariencia bastante diferente a la de otras ciudades de los Países Bajos.```
Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
**terminology/inappropriate for context** - ""Holanda Meridional"" (South Holland)  
- The Spanish translation uses ""Holanda Meridional"" (Southern Holland) to refer to the Dutch province of *South Holland* (Zuid-Holland in Dutch). However, ""Holanda"" in Spanish typically refers to the Netherlands as a whole, not a specific province. This could mislead readers into thinking the entire country is being referenced. The correct term in Spanish would be ""Zuid-Holland"" (the Dutch name) or ""South Holland"" (retaining the English name, as is common in international contexts).  

Minor:  
**style/awkward** - ""arquitectura más moderna y urbana""  
- The phrase ""urban-looking architecture"" is translated as ""arquitectura más moderna y urbana,"" which is grammatically correct but slightly imprecise. ""Urban-looking"" implies an appearance rather than inherent urban characteristics. A more natural translation might be ""arquitectura más moderna con aspecto urbano"" (modern architecture with an urban appearance). However, the meaning remains clear, so this is a minor stylistic issue.  

**Other:**

**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves the majority of the original meaning, with only two notable issues. The **major error** (""Holanda Meridional"" instead of ""South Holland"" or ""Zuid-Holland"") risks confusing readers by conflating the Netherlands as a whole with a specific province, which is a critical terminology mistake. However, the rest of the content (e.g., historical context, architectural description, and proper nouns like ""Segunda Guerra Mundial"" and ""Países Bajos"") is accurate and grammatically sound. The **minor stylistic issue** (""arquitectura más moderna y urbana"" vs. ""arquitectura moderna con aspecto urbano"") is imprecise but does not distort the meaning.

They do this by forming a special friendship with soil dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reached deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?```

Lo hacen formando una especial amistad con hongos que viven en el suelo, llamados micorrizas.

- **accuracy/omission** - ""soil"" in ""llegaron a la tierra"" (the original specifies ""landed on soil,"" but the translation uses ""arrived on land,"" omitting the specificity of ""soil"").  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""obtención de agua y nutrientes"" (literal translation of ""getting water and nutrients"" as ""obtaining water and nutrients"" is awkward and less natural than ""obtener"" as a verb).

**Reasoning:**  
The translation preserves the core meaning of the text, with most scientific concepts and context accurately conveyed. However, the two **major errors** significantly impact accuracy:  
1. **""llegaron a la tierra""** instead of **""llegaron al suelo""** (omitting ""soil"" for ""land"") alters the specificity of the original, which is critical for the scientific context of algae landing on **soil**.  
2. **""obtención de agua y nutrientes""** (noun form) is stylistically awkward and less direct than using the verb **""obtener""**, which could affect readability.

- **Major Error (shout → buena idea):** The core colloquial term ""shout"" (likely meaning ""suggestion"" or ""shout-out"") is mistranslated as ""buena idea"" (good idea), which fundamentally alters the speaker's intent. This is a critical accuracy issue, as the original implies a recommendation or informal suggestion, not a literal ""good idea.""  
- **Minor Errors:**  
  - Omission of ""skills in"" weakens contextual specificity.

```Major:  
**no-error**  

Minor:  
**none**  

**Explanation:**  
The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of ""me lo quedo"" (I'll take it) is appropriate in informal Spanish, even though it uses the present tense instead of a future tense. In colloquial speech, the present tense is often used to express future intentions. The pronoun ""Éste"" (masculine form of ""this"") is acceptable given the context, as the original text uses ""this one"" without specifying gender. The punctuation and emoticon are correctly retained. No errors disrupt the meaning or flow.```","**Score: 100**  

**Reasoning:**  
The translation perfectly preserves the original meaning, including the informal tone (""me lo quedo"" for ""I'll take it"") and the use of the emoticon. The choice of ""me lo quedo"" (present tense) to express future intent is idiomatic in colloquial Spanish, as noted in the explanation. ""Éste"" is grammatically correct for an unspecified masculine noun like ""this one.""

Soy 89,9% británico e irlandés; la mayor parte de mi ascendencia viene de la frontera escocesa, del oeste de Irlanda, Gales y Cornualles. No obstante, no se aprecia mucho de origen bretón, y esto se debe a que o bien son tan parecidos a los habitantes de Cornualles que no se notan diferencias en mí, o bien mi familia bretón no proviene de esa zona.```
Annotated error spans:
```**Major:**  
- **Accuracy/omission**: The translation omits the original's reference to the ""results"" being ""completely consistent with my family history,"" instead starting with ""Soy 89,9% británico e irlandés"" (I am 89.9% British and Irish), which adds a personal pronoun (""Soy"") not present in the source. This shifts the focus from the results to the speaker's identity, altering the original intent.  
- **Accuracy/mistranslation**: ""no se aprecia mucho de origen bretón"" (not much Breton origin is appreciated) misrepresents the original ""It doesn't show much Breton."" The phrase ""no se aprecia"" (not appreciated) implies a value judgment, whereas the original is neutral about the absence of Breton ancestry.  

**Minor:**  
- **Fluency/register**: ""Soy 89,9% británico e irlandés"" (I am 89.9% British and Irish) introduces a first-person pronoun (""Soy"") not present in the source, which may feel abrupt in the flow of the sentence. The original emphasizes the results (""The results are..."") rather than the speaker's identity.  
- **Fluency/punctuation**: The placement of the comma after ""¡redoble de tambores, por favor!"" is grammatically correct in Spanish but slightly less idiomatic than a period or em dash, though it does not disrupt understanding.  
- **Terminology/inappropriate for context**: ""breton"" is correctly translated as ""bretón,"" but ""familia bretón"" (Breton family) could be clearer as ""familia de origen bretón"" (family of Breton origin) to avoid ambiguity about the family's geographical or ethnic background.  

**Other**:  
- **No-error**: The translation accurately captures the regions (""frontera escocesa,"" ""del oeste de Irlanda,"" ""Gales,"" ""Cornualles"") and the logical structure of the explanation about Breton ancestry. The use of ""No obstante"" (However) aligns with the original's contrastive phrasing (""tho so either..."").```","**Score: 65**

**Rationale:**  
The translation preserves most of the factual content (e.g., percentages, regions, logical structure of the explanation about Breton ancestry) and maintains grammatical correctness in many areas. However, two **major errors** significantly alter the original meaning:  
1. The addition of *""Soy""* (""I am"") shifts the focus from the results being consistent with family history to the speaker's identity, which misrepresents the original intent.  
2. The mistranslation of *""It doesn't show much Breton""* to *""no se aprecia mucho de origen bretón""* introduces a value-laden implication (""not appreciated"") absent in the neutral original.  

**Minor issues** (e.g., abrupt insertion of *""Soy""*, slightly non-idiomatic punctuation, and ambiguous phrasing like *""familia bretón""*) further reduce fluency and clarity but do not overshadow the core meaning. While the translation avoids total meaning loss, the major errors prevent it from reaching the ""most meaning preserved"" threshold (66).

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""daba muchas vueltas"" (translated ""tapping a lot"" as ""making many turns,"" which is semantically incorrect; ""tapping"" implies light, repetitive contact, not rotation).  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""daba muchas vueltas con su cola de cerdo"" (translated ""pig tails swishing back and forth"" as ""was making many turns with her pig tail,"" which misrepresents the action of swishing).

The translation generally preserves the narrative tone and fluency, which aligns with the note about ""minor deviations"" not impairing understanding.

- **""destrozó mi balsa""** precisely captures ""smashed my raft,"" with appropriate verb choice and noun specificity.  
- **""en un solo movimiento""** is a natural and idiomatic equivalent of ""in a single move.""

The translation preserves **some meaning** (e.g., ""Retvik murmura desde el asiento del conductor"" captures part of the original sentence), but **major errors** severely undermine comprehension. The mistranslation of ""Oops..."" as ""¡ Uuuu!"" is nonsensical and fails to convey the intended tone or meaning. Additionally, the translation abruptly cuts off mid-sentence (""antes de"" without continuation), omitting critical actions (switching the engine off and climbing out of the truck).

Annotated error spans:
```Major:  
- **accuracy/mistranslation** - ""Correos"" (Spanish national postal service) instead of ""Post Office"" (UK entity), leading to confusion about the organization being referenced. This changes the context and specificity of the original text.  

Minor:  
- **fluency/grammar** - ""entre otros"" is placed incorrectly in the sentence structure. The phrase ""entre otros"" should follow the entity it modifies (e.g., ""por The Scotsman, entre otros""), but it is misplaced here.  
- **style/awkward** - ""la gente fue enviada a la prisión"" (literal translation of ""people were sent to prison"") is slightly awkward in Spanish, though still comprehensible. A smoother phrasing might be ""fueron enviadas a la cárcel"" or ""fueron encarceladas.""  

**No other errors** are present in the translation. The core message is preserved, though the mistranslation of ""Post Office"" as ""Correos"" is a significant contextual error.```","**Score: 65**  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Major Error (Correos vs. Post Office):** This is a significant contextual and accuracy issue, as ""Correos"" refers to Spain’s postal service, not the UK’s Post Office. This changes the specificity of the organization involved, which is central to the original text’s context. This directly impacts meaning preservation and could mislead readers about the scandal’s origin.  
- **Minor Errors:** The misplaced ""entre otros"" and awkward phrasing (""la gente fue enviada a la prisión"") are grammatical/style issues that do not severely disrupt comprehension but reduce fluency.  
- **Core Message Preservation:** Despite the major error, the translation retains the overall message about wrongful convictions, their consequences, and the historical significance of the scandal. The rest of the content is accurately translated.  

The major error significantly affects meaning, but the core message is still preserved. The minor errors are negligible compared to the contextual shift.
